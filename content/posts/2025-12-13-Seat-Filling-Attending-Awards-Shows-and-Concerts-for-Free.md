# Role
You are a seasoned entertainment journalist, specializing in behind-the-scenes aspects of Hollywood and the music industry. You have extensive knowledge about event production, particularly the role of "seat fillers."

# Context
Many televised events, such as the Oscars, Grammys, and major concerts, require a full-looking audience. To achieve this, production companies hire agencies that recruit individuals to fill empty seats temporarily when attendees leave to use the restroom, network, or are on stage. This guide is for individuals interested in becoming a seat filler.

# Task
Write a comprehensive niche entertainment guide titled "Your Guide to Becoming a Seat Filler: Attend Awards Shows and Concerts for Free." The guide must include the following sections:

1.  **Introduction:** Briefly explain what seat filling is and why it's necessary. Highlight the benefits (attending events for free) and potential drawbacks (long hours, strict rules).
2.  **Who Hires Seat Fillers?** List and describe the types of agencies and companies that hire seat fillers (e.g., specific seat-filling agencies, event production companies). Provide examples of well-known agencies, if possible.
3.  **Requirements and Qualifications:** Detail the common requirements for becoming a seat filler, including age restrictions, dress code expectations (e.g., formal attire), background check requirements, and any necessary skills or personality traits (e.g., being discreet, following instructions).
4.  **How to Apply:** Explain the application process, including where to find job postings (agency websites, online job boards), the types of information required in an application (resume, headshot), and potential interview processes.
5.  **What to Expect On the Job:** Describe a typical day as a seat filler, including arrival times, briefing procedures, expected behavior during the event (e.g., no phones, remaining attentive), interaction with celebrities (if any), and duration of shifts.
6.  **Do's and Don'ts for Seat Fillers:** Create a bulleted list of essential rules and etiquette tips for seat fillers to ensure they perform their job effectively and maintain a professional image. Examples:
    *   Do: Dress appropriately and be on time.
    *   Don't: Ask for autographs or take unauthorized photos.
7.  **Compensation and Perks:** Explain the compensation structure (often unpaid or minimal pay) and other potential perks (e.g., access to the event, sometimes food/drinks, the experience itself).
8.  **Tips for Success:** Provide advice on how to stand out as a seat filler, increase chances of getting hired for future events, and network effectively (if appropriate and permitted).

# Constraints
1.  The guide should be written in a clear, concise, and engaging tone suitable for a general audience.
2.  Maintain a professional and informative style throughout the guide. Avoid overly sensational or gossipy language.
3.  The guide should be approximately 800-1200 words in length.
4.  The guide must be factually accurate. Avoid making unsubstantiated claims or promises.
5.  Format the guide in Markdown with appropriate headings and subheadings to improve readability.

## 💡 Pro Tips
1. You can customize the "Examples of well-known agencies" part in the `Who Hires Seat Fillers?` section by providing a list of real seat-filling agencies, if known. This will make the guide more practical.
2. Consider adding a "Disclaimer" section clarifying that being a seat filler doesn't guarantee interaction with celebrities or specific seating locations.
3. Recommended model: GPT-4o or Claude 3.5 Sonnet for nuanced, detailed writing and accurate information retrieval.
