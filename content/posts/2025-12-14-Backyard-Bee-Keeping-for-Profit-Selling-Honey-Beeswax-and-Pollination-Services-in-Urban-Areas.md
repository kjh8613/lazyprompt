# 💡 Pro Tips
1.  **Customize Placeholders:** For the "Relevant Resources" section, replace placeholder text like `[Link to American Beekeeping Federation]` with actual URLs once you have generated the guide. You can also specify a particular state's beekeeping association.
2.  **Specify Region:** To get even more tailored advice on regulations, you can add a specific state (e.g., "in California") within the "Context" or "Task" if you wish, although the current prompt is designed for general US guidance.
3.  **Recommended Model:** For best results with comprehensive guides and structured outputs, use advanced large language models such as **GPT-4o, Claude 3.5 Sonnet, or Gemini 1.5 Pro.**
