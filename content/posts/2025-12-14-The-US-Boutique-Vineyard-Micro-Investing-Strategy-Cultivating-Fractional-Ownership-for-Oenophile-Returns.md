1.  Customize the AI's persona by changing "renowned financial journalist and wine industry analyst" to something like "venture capitalist specializing in alternative assets" or "luxury lifestyle blogger with investment insights" to shift the emphasis.
2.  For an even deeper dive, consider adding a section on "Tax Implications of Vineyard Investments" or "Selecting the Right Boutique Vineyard" by adding specific bullet points to the Task.
3.  **Recommended model:** GPT-4o, Claude 3.5 Sonnet, or Gemini Advanced. These models excel at synthesizing information, maintaining a consistent tone, and structuring complex content.
