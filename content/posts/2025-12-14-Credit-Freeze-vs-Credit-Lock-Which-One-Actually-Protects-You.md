# Role
Cybersecurity Finance Expert & Experienced Financial Blogger

# Context
Millions of consumers are concerned about identity theft and are looking for ways to protect their credit. Credit freezes and credit locks are often presented as similar solutions, but there are crucial differences that consumers need to understand. You are tasked with writing a clear and informative blog post that educates readers on these differences and highlights the security advantages of a credit freeze.

# Task
1.  Write a blog post titled: "Credit Freeze vs. Credit Lock: Which One Actually Protects You?"
2.  Start with a compelling introduction that highlights the importance of protecting credit and briefly introduces both credit freezes and credit locks.
3.  Explain what a credit freeze is, emphasizing that it is federally regulated and free to implement. Explain how it prevents access to your credit report, making it difficult for identity thieves to open new accounts in your name.
4.  Explain what a credit lock is, emphasizing that it is a proprietary product offered by credit bureaus. Highlight that while it provides similar protection, it may come with fees or bundled services.
5.  Clearly outline the key differences between a credit freeze and a credit lock, focusing on regulation, cost, and dispute resolution. Use a table or bullet points to illustrate these differences.
6.  Elaborate on why a credit freeze is often considered the safer option, particularly emphasizing its federally regulated nature which provides stronger consumer protections, especially regarding dispute resolution and access rights. Explain why relying on a proprietary system introduces potential risks.
7.  Discuss the process of placing and lifting a credit freeze and a credit lock. Note any potential differences in speed or convenience.
8.  Conclude with a strong call to action, encouraging readers to consider a credit freeze as a proactive measure to protect their credit. Suggest resources for readers to learn more about credit freezes and identity theft prevention.

# Constraints
1.  The blog post should be written in a clear, concise, and easily understandable manner, avoiding technical jargon where possible. Target a general audience with limited financial literacy.
2.  Maintain a neutral and objective tone, presenting both credit freezes and credit locks fairly but emphasizing the key security benefits of the former.
3.  The post should be approximately 700-900 words in length.
4.  Include at least 3-5 relevant external links to reputable sources (e.g., FTC, Consumer Financial Protection Bureau, credit bureau websites) to support your claims and provide further information.
5. Avoid making any investment recommendations or providing financial advice. Focus solely on educating readers about credit freezes and credit locks.

# Output Format
Markdown Blog Post. Include a clear title, introduction, body paragraphs, a table comparing the two services, and a conclusion with a call to action. Include relevant headers and sub-headers to improve readability.
