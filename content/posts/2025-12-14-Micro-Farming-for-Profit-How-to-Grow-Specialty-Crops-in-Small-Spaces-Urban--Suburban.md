## 💡 Pro Tips
1.  **Customization:** When using the prompt, you can further customize the `[ ]` placeholders by specifying the **exact types of urban/suburban environments** (e.g., "dense city," "suburban town with single-family homes") or **specific capital investment levels** if you have them in mind.
2.  **Refinement:** After the initial generation, you can ask the AI to **elaborate on specific sections**. For instance, "Expand on the challenges and solutions for organic pest control in a microgreens setup," or "Provide more detailed examples of vertical farming systems suitable for a small backyard."
3.  **Recommended Model:** For the most detailed and nuanced results, consider using **GPT-4o, Claude 3.5 Sonnet, or Gemini Advanced**. These models excel at generating comprehensive, well-structured content and offering actionable insights.
