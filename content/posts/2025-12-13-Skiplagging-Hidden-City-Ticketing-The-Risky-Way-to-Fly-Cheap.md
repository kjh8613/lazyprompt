# Role
Expert Travel Hacker & Contrarian Journalist

# Context
You're writing a no-holds-barred travel guide for savvy individuals looking to exploit loopholes in the airline industry for massive savings. The guide focuses specifically on "skiplagging" (also known as hidden-city ticketing), where passengers book flights with layovers but intentionally skip the final leg of the journey. The target audience is price-sensitive but risk-aware travelers.

# Task
Write a controversial travel guide on skiplagging, covering the following points in a clear and engaging manner:

1.  **The Economics of Skiplagging:** Explain *why* this price discrepancy exists (e.g., airlines pricing routes based on demand hubs, competition, etc.). Use simple, understandable terms. Provide a hypothetical example of a flight from City A to City B costing $500, while a flight from City A to City C *with a layover in City B* costing only $300. Illustrate the potential savings.
2.  **How to Find Skiplagging Opportunities:** Briefly mention (without explicitly endorsing) resources where users might research hidden city ticketing options (e.g., pointing to websites or search engines). *Avoid* directly linking to or naming specific services; instead, describe what such resources do.
3.  **The Dark Side: Risks and Consequences:**  Thoroughly detail all potential risks, including:
    *   Airline bans (and how airlines might detect skiplagging).
    *   Voiding of connecting flights (if you try to skiplag on the *first* leg).
    *   Baggage restrictions (only carry-on luggage is truly safe).
    *   Frequent flyer account penalties.
    *   Potential legal repercussions (although rare).
    *   Explain that airlines *hate* this practice and actively try to prevent it.
4.  **Mitigation Strategies (Maybe):** Offer *potential* strategies for minimizing the risks, but emphasize that there's no foolproof method.  Examples: using different frequent flyer numbers, avoiding checking baggage, booking one-way flights, using different airlines, etc. Frame these strategies as "rumors" or "things people say."
5.  **Is It Worth It? A Moral and Practical Dilemma:** Conclude with a balanced discussion of the ethics and practicality of skiplagging. Acknowledge the potential savings but strongly advise readers to carefully weigh the risks before attempting it. Remind them that this practice violates airline terms and conditions.

# Constraints
*   **Tone:** Conversational, slightly edgy, and informative. Avoid overly technical jargon. Be brutally honest about the risks.
*   **Legality:** DO NOT provide any advice that could be construed as encouraging illegal activity. Clearly state that skiplagging violates airline terms and conditions. Frame the guide as an exploration of a controversial practice, not an endorsement.
*   **Length:** Aim for approximately 800-1200 words.
*   **Format:** Write the guide in a Markdown format suitable for a blog post. Use headings and subheadings to structure the content logically.
*   **Ethics:** DO NOT explicitly endorse or encourage skiplagging. Present it as a controversial practice with significant risks.

# Output Format
Markdown blog post.

## 💡 Pro Tips
1.  Customize the "Contrarian Journalist" persona to adjust the tone. A more neutral persona will result in a less provocative guide.
2.  Provide specific examples of flight routes in the Context to make the AI's explanations more concrete.
3.  Experiment with different keywords related to "airline loopholes" and "travel hacks" to see how they influence the content.
4.  Recommended model: GPT-4o for best balance of creativity and risk awareness, Claude 3.5 Sonnet for a more cautious and responsible tone. Gemini might require extra caution in managing the "controversy" aspect.
