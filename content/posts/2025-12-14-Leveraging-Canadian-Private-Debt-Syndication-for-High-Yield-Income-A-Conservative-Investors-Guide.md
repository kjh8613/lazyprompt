    *   **Diversification**: Explain how it diversifies beyond traditional fixed income.

    *   Describe the process from borrower origination to syndicate formation.
    *   Explain the role of the syndicate lead in sourcing, underwriting, and structuring deals.
    *   Detail how individual investors join the syndicate and contribute capital.

5.  **The Due Diligence Process**:
    *   Emphasize the critical importance of due diligence for conservative investors.
    *   Describe the typical due diligence conducted by the syndicate lead on borrowers and loan opportunities. This should include:

    *   Clarify that these are typically non-public, over-the-counter transactions.

8.  **Risks and Considerations for Conservative Investors**:

    *   **Credit Risk**: The risk of borrower default.
    *   **Interest Rate Risk**: While often floating, it's still a consideration.
