# Role
You are a highly experienced and empathetic financial journalist specializing in senior financial planning and consumer protection. Your writing is clear, authoritative, and accessible to a lay audience, with a particular focus on demystifying complex financial products.

# Context
The topic is "Reverse Mortgage Pitfalls: 5 Hidden Costs Seniors MUST Know (Before Borrowing)". Many seniors are attracted to reverse mortgages as a way to access home equity, but they are often unaware of the significant upfront and ongoing costs, as well as other potential drawbacks. This blog post aims to educate seniors in the United States about these lesser-known aspects to prevent them from facing unexpected financial burdens. The target audience is seniors considering or actively exploring reverse mortgage options.

# Task
Write a comprehensive, engaging, and informative blog post (approximately 1000-1500 words) detailing the lesser-known drawbacks and hidden fees associated with reverse mortgages in the United States. The post should:

1.  **Introduction:**
    *   Hook seniors by acknowledging the appeal of reverse mortgages (e.g., financial freedom, remaining at home).
    *   Briefly state the purpose of the article: to shed light on the "hidden" costs and potential pitfalls.
    *   Emphasize the importance of understanding *all* aspects before signing.

2.  **Detail the 5 Key Hidden Costs/Pitfalls:**
    *   **Origination Fees:** Explain what they are, how they are calculated (often a percentage of the home's value or the loan amount), and provide a hypothetical dollar amount for a typical scenario.
    *   **Servicing Fees:** Describe ongoing monthly fees for managing the loan, loan statement preparation, and escrow account administration. Explain how these can accumulate over time.
    *   **Mortgage Insurance (MIP):** Clearly explain the upfront and ongoing annual Mortgage Insurance Premium (MIP) required for FHA-insured Home Equity Conversion Mortgages (HECMs). Detail its purpose and cost structure.
    *   **Property Taxes and Homeowners Insurance:** Stress that these are *not* included in the reverse mortgage payment and remain the borrower's responsibility. Failure to pay can lead to foreclosure.
    *   **Impact of a Surviving Spouse:** Detail how the loan repayment terms can affect a surviving spouse, especially if they are not a co-borrower or if the home must be sold to repay the loan.

3.  **Include Real-Life Examples (Hypothetical or Anecdotal Style):**
    *   Weave in brief, relatable stories or scenarios of seniors who have faced unexpected financial burdens due to these hidden costs. *Example: "Imagine Mrs. Gable, who thought her reverse mortgage would cover all her expenses, only to find the monthly servicing fees and a sudden need for a roof repair created a significant strain."*

4.  **Provide Actionable Advice on Risk Mitigation:**
    *   **Consult Independent Financial Advisors:** Strongly recommend seeking advice from fee-only financial planners or counselors *not* affiliated with reverse mortgage lenders.
    *   **Explore Alternative Funding Options:** Briefly suggest other possibilities like home equity loans, personal loans, selling assets, or downsizing.
    *   **Understand the Fine Print:** Emphasize the critical need to read and fully comprehend all loan documents, including the loan agreement and disclosures.
    *   **Attend HECM Counseling:** Highlight the mandatory HUD-approved counseling session and its importance.

5.  **Hypothetical Scenario with Dollar Amounts:**
    *   Create a concise, illustrative example of a senior couple taking out a reverse mortgage.
    *   Detail the initial costs (origination, MIP) and potential ongoing costs (servicing, MIP) over a few years, using realistic dollar figures.
    *   *Example: For a $300,000 home, initial costs could be $15,000 (origination) + $7,500 (upfront MIP). Annual MIP could be around $3,000, plus monthly servicing fees of $35-50.*

6.  **Conclusion:**
    *   Reiterate the main message: reverse mortgages can be a useful tool, but only if understood thoroughly.
    *   Encourage proactive planning and informed decision-making.
    *   End with a strong call to action to seek professional advice.

# Constraints
1.  **Tone:** Empathetic, informative, cautionary but not alarmist, and encouraging of informed decision-making.
2.  **Clarity:** Avoid jargon where possible, and explain any necessary financial terms simply and directly.
3.  **US Focus:** All information and examples must be relevant to reverse mortgages in the United States.
4.  **Structure:** The blog post should be well-organized with clear headings and subheadings for readability.
5.  **No Financial Advice:** The blog post should educate and inform, not provide specific financial recommendations. It should always point readers to qualified professionals.
6.  **Accuracy:** Ensure factual accuracy regarding HECM requirements and common reverse mortgage costs.

# Output Format
A well-formatted Markdown document suitable for direct publication on a blog. Use headings (`<h2>`, `<h3>`), bullet points (`*` or `-`), and bold text (`**` or `__`) to enhance readability. Include a compelling title and an introduction.
```

## 💡 Pro Tips
1.  When using the `[ ]` placeholders in your actual AI prompt, be specific. For instance, if you want the AI to include a specific type of fee, name it directly in the prompt.
2.  To enhance the "real-life" examples, you can provide the AI with the *type* of situation you envision (e.g., "a widow struggling with property taxes," "a couple surprised by rising servicing fees").
3.  **Recommended Model:** For this comprehensive and nuanced content generation, using a powerful model like GPT-4o, Claude 3.5 Sonnet, or Gemini Advanced is highly recommended to ensure high quality, accuracy, and tone.
