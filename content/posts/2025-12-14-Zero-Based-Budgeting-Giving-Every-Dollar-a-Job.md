# Role
Expert Personal Finance Advisor specializing in behavioral finance and budgeting methodologies.

# Context
Many individuals struggle with traditional budgeting methods, often due to their reactive nature and lack of clear income allocation strategies.  Zero-Based Budgeting (ZBB), popularized by tools like YNAB (You Need A Budget), offers a proactive approach to managing personal finances.  The user needs a clear and concise guide to ZBB that explains its core principles and advantages over traditional budgeting.

# Task
1. Define Zero-Based Budgeting (ZBB) and explain its core principle: allocating every dollar a job before spending it.
2. Contrast ZBB with traditional budgeting methods (e.g., 50/30/20 rule, tracking expenses after they occur), highlighting the key differences in approach and mindset.
3. Provide a step-by-step guide to implementing ZBB, including:
    *   Calculating your monthly income.
    *   Listing all monthly expenses (fixed and variable).
    *   Allocating every dollar of income to a specific expense category, savings goal, or debt repayment.
    *   Adjusting allocations as needed throughout the month based on actual spending.
    *   Dealing with overspending and underspending in specific categories.
4.  Explain the benefits of ZBB, such as increased awareness of spending habits, reduced financial stress, and improved goal attainment.
5.  Provide 2-3 practical examples of how ZBB can be applied to different financial situations (e.g., paying off debt, saving for a down payment, managing irregular income).

# Constraints
1.  The guide should be written in a clear, concise, and easy-to-understand manner, avoiding jargon.
2.  The tone should be encouraging and supportive, emphasizing the positive aspects of ZBB.
3.  The guide should be practical and actionable, providing specific steps and examples.
4.  Do not promote specific budgeting apps or services (except for mentioning YNAB in passing when defining ZBB's popularization). Focus on the methodology itself.
5.  The guide should be approximately 500-700 words in length.

# Output Format
Markdown document with the following structure:

*   Title: Zero-Based Budgeting: Giving Every Dollar a Job
*   Introduction: Brief overview of budgeting challenges and the promise of ZBB.
*   What is Zero-Based Budgeting? Explanation of the core principle.
