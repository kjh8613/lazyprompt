## 💡 Pro Tips
1.  **Customize State/Local Details:** If you have specific states or even cities in mind beyond California and Oregon, replace them in the prompt with `[Your State/City]` and provide specific details to the AI if known (e.g., "mentioning the specific statewide ADU laws for [Your State] and common local challenges like [specific local challenge]").
2.  **Refine ROI Scenarios:** For more tailored ROI examples, you can specify the desired "Total Initial Investment" or "Target Annual Rental Income" in the prompt. For example, you could add to Step 4: "Create one scenario with an initial investment under $150,000 and another under $300,000."
3.  **Recommended Model:** GPT-4o, Claude 3.5 Sonnet, or Gemini Advanced are recommended for their advanced reasoning and ability to generate detailed, well-structured content.
