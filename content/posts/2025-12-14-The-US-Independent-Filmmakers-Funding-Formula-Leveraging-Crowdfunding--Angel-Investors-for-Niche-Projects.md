## 💡 Pro Tips
1.  **Customize the Role:** If you have a specific niche in mind for your film (e.g., documentary, sci-fi, horror), you can slightly tweak the "Role" to "Act as a seasoned, award-winning independent film producer *specializing in [your film genre]* and a financial strategist..." for more tailored advice.
2.  **Add Your Personal Experience:** After generating the text, inject 1-2 brief anecdotes or specific examples from your own (or fictionalized) filmmaking journey to add authenticity and relatability.
3.  **Recommended Model:** GPT-4o or Claude 3.5 Sonnet are excellent choices for this task due to their strong writing capabilities and ability to handle nuanced instructions.
