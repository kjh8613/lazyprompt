## 💡 Pro Tips
1.  **Customize the [ ] Placeholders:** While this prompt is designed to be copy-paste ready, if you have a specific niche within suburban American homes (e.g., older homes, new construction, specific regional styles), you can add that detail to the "Context" section for even more tailored output.
2.  **Provide Example Scenarios:** For a more personalized blog post, consider adding a brief example scenario in the "Context" section. For instance, "Imagine a homeowner wanting to update their kitchen but only budgeting for cabinets and countertops, forgetting plumbing changes and appliance installation." This can guide the AI in crafting more relatable examples.
3.  **Recommended Model:** To achieve the highest quality and most nuanced content, use models like **GPT-4o**, **Claude 3.5 Sonnet**, or **Gemini Advanced**. These models excel at understanding complex instructions, maintaining tone, and generating comprehensive, well-structured content.
