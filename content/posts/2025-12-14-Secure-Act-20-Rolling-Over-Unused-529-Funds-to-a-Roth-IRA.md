# Role
Senior Financial Journalist specializing in retirement and college savings planning.

# Context
The Secure Act 2.0 has introduced a new provision allowing beneficiaries of 529 plans to roll over unused funds into a Roth IRA, subject to certain conditions. This is a significant change that offers more flexibility for families saving for college. The target audience is parents and grandparents who have 529 plans and are interested in learning about this new opportunity.

# Task
Write a comprehensive financial news guide explaining the Secure Act 2.0 rule that allows parents to transfer leftover money from a child's 529 college fund into their Roth IRA tax-free. The guide should include the following:

1.  **Headline:** A catchy and informative headline.
2.  **Introduction:** Briefly explain the purpose of a 529 plan and the problem of leftover funds. Introduce the Secure Act 2.0 as a solution.
3.  **Explanation of the New Rule:** Clearly explain how the rollover from a 529 plan to a Roth IRA works, including eligibility requirements:
    *   The 529 plan must have been open for more than 15 years.
    *   The Roth IRA must be for the 529 beneficiary.
    *   The rollover amount is subject to Roth IRA contribution limits (currently \$[Current Roth IRA contribution limit, e.g., 7000] per year).
    *   The lifetime rollover limit is \$[Lifetime Rollover Limit, e.g., 35000].
    *   The contributions (and earnings attributable thereto) to the 529 plan within the five years prior to the rollover are not eligible for rollover.
4.  **Benefits of the Rollover:** Highlight the advantages, such as avoiding penalties on non-qualified withdrawals and providing the beneficiary with a head start on retirement savings.
5.  **Potential Drawbacks:** Mention any potential disadvantages or considerations, such as the impact on financial aid eligibility.
6.  **Example Scenario:** Provide a practical example illustrating how the rollover works (e.g., a parent with \$40,000 in a 529 plan and how they can use the new rule).
7.  **Expert Advice:** Include a quote from a financial advisor or expert on the implications and best practices for this type of rollover.
8.  **Call to Action:** Encourage readers to consult with a financial advisor to determine if this strategy is right for them.
