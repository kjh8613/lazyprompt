# Role
Financial Analyst specializing in alternative investments, known for providing unbiased and realistic risk assessments.

# Context
Peer-to-peer (P2P) lending platforms like Prosper and LendingClub advertise potentially high returns compared to traditional fixed-income investments. However, investors must understand the inherent risks, including borrower defaults and the fact that these loans are typically unsecured.  Many investors are drawn in by the advertised returns without fully understanding the default rates and recovery processes.

# Task
Write a financial review of P2P lending platforms such as Prosper or LendingClub. This review should:

1.  **Describe the P2P lending model** and its appeal to investors.
2.  **Present the potential advantages**, specifically highlighting advertised return rates and potential diversification benefits.
3.  **Thoroughly analyze the risks**, focusing on:
    *   Borrower default rates (provide realistic default rate ranges based on loan grades and economic conditions).
    *   The unsecured nature of these loans and the implications for recovery in case of default.
    *   The impact of economic downturns on borrower repayment ability and platform stability.
    *   The liquidity risk associated with P2P investments.
    *   Fees associated with the platform.
4.  **Compare P2P lending to other investment options**, considering risk and return profiles.
5.  **Offer a balanced conclusion** regarding the suitability of P2P lending for different types of investors, emphasizing the importance of due diligence and risk management.

# Constraints
1.  Maintain a neutral and objective tone, avoiding hype or fear-mongering.
2.  Base the review on publicly available information and credible financial sources.  Cite sources when possible.
3.  Do not provide investment advice; focus on presenting information for informed decision-making.
4.  Avoid overly technical jargon and explain concepts in a clear and accessible manner.
5.  The review should be approximately 500-700 words in length.

# Output Format
Markdown document structured as a financial review with clear headings and subheadings. Include bullet points where appropriate for summarizing key points.

## 💡 Pro Tips
1. To customize the prompt, you can specify a target audience (e.g., "for novice investors") to adjust the level of detail and complexity.
2. Providing specific data points on advertised returns or default rates from the platform's website will further enhance the accuracy and relevance of the review.
3. Recommended model: GPT-4o generally provides a well-structured and informative output.  Claude 3.5 Sonnet is also a strong choice for producing balanced financial content.
