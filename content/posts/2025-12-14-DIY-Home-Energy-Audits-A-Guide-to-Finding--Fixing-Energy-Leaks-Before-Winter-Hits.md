# Role
You are a highly experienced and engaging Home Improvement Blogger and Energy Efficiency Expert, known for your ability to explain complex topics in simple, accessible language. You are passionate about empowering homeowners to save money and reduce their environmental impact.

# Context
The blog post is for a website aimed at homeowners looking for practical, DIY solutions to common household problems. The target audience is likely budget-conscious and may not have extensive technical knowledge. The timing for this content is crucial – it needs to be published before winter to help readers prepare their homes for the cold season and prevent energy waste.

# Task
Write a detailed blog post titled "DIY Home Energy Audits: A Guide to Finding & Fixing Energy Leaks (Before Winter Hits)". The blog post should:

1.  **Introduction:**
    *   Hook the reader by highlighting the importance of energy audits for saving money and improving home comfort, especially before winter.
    *   Briefly explain what an energy audit is and why a DIY approach is beneficial.

2.  **Gather Your Tools (Inexpensive & Easy):**
    *   Introduce essential, affordable tools for a DIY audit:
        *   **Infrared Thermometer:** Explain what it is and how it helps detect temperature differences indicating leaks.
        *   **Smoke Pencil/Candle:** Explain its function in visualizing air movement.
        *   **Caulk Gun & Caulk:** For sealing gaps.
        *   **Weatherstripping:** For doors and windows.
        *   **Insulation Tape:** For pipes.
        *   **Flashlight:** Essential for visual inspection.
        *   **Pen and Paper/Digital Notes:** For recording findings.
    *   **Crucially, include placeholder for photos/illustrations for each tool.** (e.g., `[Photo of Infrared Thermometer]`)

3.  **Step-by-Step DIY Energy Audit Guide:**
    *   **Section 1: Windows and Doors:**
        *   **Identify Leaks:** Explain how to use the smoke pencil around frames and weatherstripping. Describe how to use the infrared thermometer to find cold spots on glass and frames.
        *   **Fixes:** Provide clear, step-by-step instructions for:
            *   Applying caulk around frames.
            *   Installing or replacing weatherstripping.
            *   Using window film (optional but good to mention).
        *   **Placeholder for photos/illustrations:** `[Illustration of applying caulk to a window frame]`, `[Photo of weatherstripping being installed]`
    *   **Section 2: Electrical Outlets and Switches:**
        *   **Identify Leaks:** Explain how to use the smoke pencil to check for drafts around outlet and switch plates on exterior walls.
        *   **Fixes:** Step-by-step instructions for installing foam gaskets behind the plates. (Emphasize safety – turn off power).
        *   **Placeholder for photos/illustrations:** `[Photo of foam outlet gasket]`
    *   **Section 3: Attic and Basement/Crawl Space:**
        *   **Identify Leaks:** Focus on common spots like where pipes, wires, or chimneys enter/exit the living space. Explain visual inspection for gaps and using the smoke pencil.
        *   **Fixes:** Briefly mention sealing larger gaps with expanding foam sealant (with safety precautions) and insulating accessible pipes (hot water pipes specifically).
        *   **Placeholder for photos/illustrations:** `[Illustration of insulating a hot water pipe]`
    *   **Section 4: Vents and Other Openings:**
        *   **Identify Leaks:** Explain checking around dryer vents, plumbing vents, and exhaust fans.
        *   **Fixes:** Suggest sealing any visible gaps.

4.  **Thermostat Smarts:**
    *   Provide simple tips for optimizing thermostat settings to save energy without sacrificing comfort (e.g., programmable thermostats, setting back temperatures when away or sleeping).

5.  **Calculating Potential Cost Savings:**
    *   Provide a simplified method or example for estimating potential savings. Suggest readers track their energy bills before and after implementing fixes.
    *   Explain how to justify the investment in materials (caulk, weatherstripping, etc.) by showing a quick ROI (Return on Investment) based on estimated savings.

6.  **Government Incentives and Rebates:**
    *   Include a section encouraging readers to research available local, state, and federal incentives for energy-efficient upgrades.
    *   **Crucially, provide placeholders for links to useful resources.** (e.g., `[Link to ENERGY STAR Home Energy Rebates Finder]`, `[Link to Local Utility Company Website]`)

7.  **Conclusion:**
    *   Reiterate the benefits of a DIY energy audit.
    *   Encourage readers to start their audit and share their results.
    *   Provide a call to action (e.g., "Start your energy audit today!").

# Constraints
1.  **Tone:** Friendly, encouraging, authoritative, and practical. Avoid jargon and technical terms where possible, or explain them clearly.
2.  **Clarity:** Instructions must be step-by-step and easy for a novice to follow.
3.  **Visuals:** Explicitly request placeholders for photos and illustrations at relevant points.
4.  **Focus:** Prioritize common, easily fixable issues and inexpensive solutions.

## 💡 Pro Tips
1.  **Customize Placeholders:** When you use the generated output, you can replace `[Photo of X]` with actual images you find or create, and `[Link to Y]` with the relevant URLs. For a more complete blog post, consider sourcing stock photos or creating simple diagrams.
2.  **Geographic Specificity:** For even better results, you could add a phrase to the prompt like: "Tailor the section on government incentives to common programs found in [Your State/Region] if possible." This would require the AI to have access to or knowledge about those specific programs.
3.  **Recommended Model:** For this task, **GPT-4o** or **Claude 3.5 Sonnet** would be excellent choices due to their strong writing capabilities and ability to follow complex instructions with good contextual understanding.
