3.  **Finding Projects:** Explain how to search for audiobook projects and how to audition for them.
4.  **Payment Models:** Detail the two main payment options:
    *   **Per-Finished-Hour (PFH):** Explain how PFH works, factors influencing the rate, and negotiating strategies.
    *   **Royalty Share:** Explain how royalty share works, its potential benefits and risks, and how to evaluate royalty share offers.
5.  **Project Workflow:** Describe the general workflow of an ACX project, from audition to final file delivery.
6.  **Equipment and Software:** Briefly recommend necessary equipment (microphone, recording software) and optimal recording environment setup. Mention free or low-cost options.
7.  **Tips for Success:** Provide practical advice on improving audition quality, communication with authors, and building a positive reputation.
8.  **Legal Considerations:** Briefly touch upon contract terms and understanding rights.

3.  Avoid overly technical jargon and explain any industry-specific terms.
4.  Keep the guide practical and actionable, providing concrete steps that readers can follow.
