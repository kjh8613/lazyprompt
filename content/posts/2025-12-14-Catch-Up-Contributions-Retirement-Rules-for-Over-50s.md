# Role
Senior Financial Advisor specializing in retirement planning.

# Context
Many individuals over 50 are concerned about not having saved enough for retirement. Catch-up contributions are a valuable tool for those who started saving later in life or need to boost their retirement savings quickly. You need to explain the IRS rules regarding these contributions in a clear, informative, and engaging blog post.

# Task
1.  Write a blog post titled: "Catch-Up Contributions: Retirement Rules for Over-50s."
2.  Begin with an introduction that acknowledges the concerns of people over 50 regarding retirement savings and introduces catch-up contributions as a solution.
3.  Clearly explain what catch-up contributions are for both 401(k)s and IRAs, including current IRS limits (use placeholder brackets like [401k Catch-Up Limit 2024] and [IRA Catch-Up Limit 2024]—the AI will fill these in). Mention that these limits can change annually.
4.  Provide specific examples of how catch-up contributions can significantly impact retirement savings over time, including hypothetical scenarios.
5.  Explain the eligibility requirements for making catch-up contributions (age 50 or older).
6.  Briefly discuss the importance of consulting with a financial advisor to determine the best retirement savings strategy.
7.  Include a call to action at the end, encouraging readers to take control of their retirement planning and seek professional advice.
8.  Structure the blog post with clear headings and subheadings for readability.

# Constraints
1.  The tone should be informative, encouraging, and easy to understand for a general audience. Avoid overly technical jargon.
2.  The blog post should be approximately 500-700 words in length.
3.  Accurately represent current IRS regulations and contribution limits, using the placeholders provided for the AI to fill.
4.  Do not provide financial advice specific to any individual; keep the information general and educational.
5.  Maintain a professional and trustworthy voice.

# Output Format
Markdown blog post.
```

## 💡 Pro Tips
1.  Replace the bracketed placeholders, such as `[401k Catch-Up Limit 2024]` and `[IRA Catch-Up Limit 2024]`, with the *current* year to ensure accurate information. You can also add future years to prompt the model for potential future values, though remember these are projections.
2.  Consider adding specific details about the types of readers you want to attract (e.g., "individuals nearing retirement with limited savings") to further refine the post's tone and focus.
3.  Recommended model: GPT-4o or Claude 3.5 Sonnet, as they excel at providing accurate and up-to-date financial information.
