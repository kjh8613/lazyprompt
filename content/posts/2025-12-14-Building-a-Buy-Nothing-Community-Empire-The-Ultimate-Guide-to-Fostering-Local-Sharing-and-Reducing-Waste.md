## 💡 Pro Tips
1.  **Contextualize Examples:** While the prompt asks for generic examples, you can make the output even more impactful by imagining a specific type of local community (e.g., a bustling city neighborhood, a quiet suburban town, a rural area) and asking the AI to tailor examples of events or local outreach strategies to that context.
2.  **Highlight a Specific Challenge:** If you have a particular challenge in mind (e.g., a group struggling with too many "asks" and not enough "offers," or a specific conflict type), you can add a small note in the 'Task' section, asking the AI to briefly touch on that within the relevant moderation or conflict resolution sections.
3.  **Recommended Model:** For the best results with detailed content generation and structured output, we recommend using advanced models such as **GPT-4o, Claude 3.5 Sonnet, or Google Gemini Advanced**.
