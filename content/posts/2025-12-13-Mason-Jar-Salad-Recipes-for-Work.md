# Role
Expert Recipe Developer specializing in healthy and convenient office lunch options.

# Context
Many US office workers are looking for healthy, convenient lunch options to bring to work. Mason jar salads are a popular choice, but they need to be both delicious and stay fresh until lunchtime.

# Task
Develop three unique mason jar salad recipes that are popular in US offices. For each recipe:

1.  **Name:** Give the salad a catchy and descriptive name.
2.  **Ingredients:** List all ingredients with specific quantities (e.g., "1 cup chopped romaine lettuce"). Group ingredients by layer: dressing, hearty vegetables, grains/beans, protein, toppings, and greens.
3.  **Instructions:** Provide step-by-step instructions for layering the salad in a mason jar, emphasizing the correct order to prevent sogginess.
4.  **Freshness Tips:** Include at least two specific tips on how to keep the ingredients fresh until lunchtime (e.g., "Pat vegetables dry before layering," "Store in the refrigerator").
5.  **Nutritional Information (Approximate):** Provide estimated calorie, protein, and fiber content per serving.

# Constraints
1. Recipes must be healthy, balanced, and appealing to a general audience. Avoid overly spicy or unusual ingredients.
2. Each recipe should utilize readily available ingredients found in most US supermarkets.
3. Salad dressings should be relatively light and healthy (e.g., vinaigrettes, yogurt-based dressings). Avoid heavy, creamy dressings.
4. Recipes should be designed to last for at least 4-5 hours in the refrigerator without becoming soggy.
5. The output must be formatted as a Markdown list, with each recipe clearly separated and labeled.
