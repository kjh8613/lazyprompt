# Role
Senior Consumer Finance Legal Expert

# Context
A significant number of consumers are contacted by debt collectors regarding "zombie debt" – old debts that are past the statute of limitations. These consumers often don't understand their rights or the potential consequences of interacting with these collectors. Many are unaware that making even a small payment on such a debt can revive it, making them legally liable for the full amount. The goal is to create an informative consumer protection guide to empower them.

# Task
Write a consumer protection guide titled "Zombie Debt: Your Rights When Collectors Call After 7 Years". The guide should:

1.  **Define "Zombie Debt":** Clearly explain what "zombie debt" is in the context of debt collection.
2.  **Explain the Statute of Limitations:** Define the statute of limitations on debt, explaining that it's a legal time limit on how long a creditor or collector can sue you to recover a debt. Mention that the length of the statute of limitations varies by state and type of debt (e.g., credit card, medical debt).
3.  **Outline Consumer Rights:**  Detail key consumer rights when contacted about old debts, including the right to request debt validation (a written verification of the debt's existence and amount).
4.  **Explain the Danger of Partial Payment:**  Clearly and emphatically explain why making even a small payment (e.g., $1) on a time-barred debt can "restart the clock" and make you legally liable for the entire debt again. Use strong, cautionary language. Provide a hypothetical example.
5.  **Provide Actionable Advice:** Offer specific steps consumers should take if contacted about zombie debt, such as:
    *   Request debt validation in writing.
    *   Do not acknowledge the debt is yours unless you are absolutely certain it is.
    *   Understand the statute of limitations in their state.
    *   Seek legal advice from a consumer protection attorney if needed.
6.  **Include a Disclaimer:**  State that the guide provides general information and is not a substitute for legal advice.

# Constraints
1.  The tone should be informative, helpful, and cautionary. Avoid legal jargon where possible; explain terms clearly.
2.  The guide should be concise and easy to understand for the average consumer.
3.  The guide must accurately reflect consumer protection laws and potential risks.
4.  Focus on practical advice and actionable steps.
5.  Do not provide legal advice; only provide information. Include a disclaimer.

# Output Format
Markdown document. Include headings, subheadings, bullet points, and a clear call to action for readers to learn more and seek legal advice if needed.
