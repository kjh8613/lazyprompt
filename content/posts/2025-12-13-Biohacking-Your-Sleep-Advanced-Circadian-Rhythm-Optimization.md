# Role
Expert Science Journalist specializing in longevity and biohacking.

# Context
The modern lifestyle often disrupts natural sleep patterns, negatively impacting health and lifespan. Readers are increasingly interested in science-backed strategies to optimize their sleep and improve their overall well-being. They are looking for advanced techniques beyond basic sleep hygiene tips.

# Task
Write a comprehensive health article titled "Biohacking Your Sleep: Advanced Circadian Rhythm Optimization for Longevity." The article should:

1.  **Introduction (approx. 100 words):** Define biohacking in the context of sleep and briefly explain the importance of sleep for longevity and overall health. Highlight the limitations of traditional sleep advice and introduce the concept of advanced optimization.
2.  **Understanding Circadian Rhythms (approx. 200 words):** Explain the science behind circadian rhythms and their influence on sleep, hormone regulation, and other bodily functions. Describe the master clock (SCN) and its role in synchronizing internal processes.
3.  **Light Management (approx. 250 words):** Detail specific strategies for optimizing light exposure:
    *   **Morning Light:** Emphasize the importance of early morning sunlight exposure (intensity, duration, benefits).
    *   **Evening Light:** Explain the negative impact of blue light and strategies for minimizing exposure (blue light filters, red light therapy, avoiding screens). Suggest optimal evening lighting conditions.
4.  **Temperature Regulation (approx. 250 words):** Explain the relationship between core body temperature and sleep quality. Provide actionable strategies for temperature regulation:
    *   **Pre-sleep Cooling:** Recommend specific methods for lowering core body temperature before bed (cool showers, temperature-controlled mattress pads, room temperature recommendations).
    *   **Sleep Environment:** Suggest optimal bedroom temperature ranges and ventilation strategies.
5.  **Circadian Rhythm Hacking (approx. 300 words):** Explore advanced techniques for fine-tuning circadian rhythms:
    *   **Meal Timing:** Describe the impact of meal timing on circadian rhythms (intermittent fasting, time-restricted feeding). Provide meal timing recommendations for optimal sleep.
    *   **Supplementation:** Discuss evidence-based supplements that may support circadian rhythm regulation (melatonin, magnesium, L-theanine, etc.). Include dosage recommendations and potential side effects, with a disclaimer to consult a healthcare professional.
    *   **Chronotherapy:** Briefly explain the concept of chronotherapy and its potential applications for adjusting sleep schedules (e.g., for shift workers).
6.  **Conclusion (approx. 100 words):** Summarize the key takeaways and emphasize the importance of personalized experimentation for finding the most effective sleep optimization strategies. Reiterate the link between optimized sleep and improved longevity.

# Constraints
*   **Tone:** Science-backed, informative, and engaging. Avoid overly technical jargon. Target a general audience interested in health and wellness.
*   **Accuracy:** Ensure all information is accurate and supported by scientific evidence. Cite credible sources where appropriate (e.g., research studies, expert opinions).
*   **Clarity:** Use clear and concise language. Break down complex concepts into easily digestible information.
*   **Actionability:** Provide practical and actionable advice that readers can implement immediately.
*   **Prohibition:** Do not provide medical advice. Include a disclaimer stating that readers should consult with a healthcare professional before making significant changes to their sleep habits or supplementation regimen.
