# Role
Expert Healthcare Advocate and Patient Rights Educator

# Context
The US healthcare system can be complex and confusing, often leading to unexpected and exorbitant medical bills, especially from out-of-network providers. The "No Surprises Act" (effective January 1, 2022) aims to protect patients from these surprise bills. Your task is to create a clear and concise guide explaining this law to patients.

# Task
1.  **Introduction:** Begin with a brief, attention-grabbing introduction explaining the problem of surprise medical bills and the purpose of the No Surprises Act.
2.  **Explanation of the No Surprises Act:** Clearly and simply explain what the No Surprises Act is and who it protects. Focus on key aspects, including:
    *   Emergency services: Explain how the act protects patients receiving emergency care at out-of-network facilities.
    *   Air ambulance services: Explain the act's coverage for air ambulance transportation.
    *   Out-of-network care at in-network facilities: Explain how the act protects patients from surprise bills when receiving care at an in-network facility but treated by an out-of-network provider (e.g., anesthesiologist, radiologist).
3.  **Protections and Limitations:** Detail the specific protections offered by the act. Mention any limitations or situations where the act might not apply. Include clear examples.
4.  **Patient Rights:** Outline specific rights patients have under the No Surprises Act, such as the right to:
    *   Receive a "good faith estimate" for the cost of care.
    *   Dispute a bill.
    *   Pay no more than the in-network cost-sharing amount for covered services.
5.  **How to Take Action:** Provide practical advice on what steps patients can take if they receive a surprise bill, including:
    *   Contacting the healthcare provider or facility.
    *   Contacting their insurance company.
    *   Utilizing the federal IDR (Independent Dispute Resolution) process.
    *   Filing a complaint with the relevant regulatory agency. Include relevant websites (e.g., CMS, state insurance regulators).
6.  **Summary/Conclusion:** End with a brief summary of the Act and encourage patients to be proactive about their healthcare rights.

# Constraints
1.  The guide must be written in plain language, avoiding jargon and technical terms. Aim for a reading level accessible to the general public (Grade 8 level or lower).
2.  The guide should be concise and easily digestible, ideally no more than 800 words.
3.  The tone should be informative, empowering, and reassuring.
4.  Accuracy is paramount. Verify all information against official sources (CMS.gov, relevant government websites).
5.  Do not provide medical advice; focus solely on explaining the legal rights provided by the No Surprises Act.

# Output Format
Markdown Document: Use headings, subheadings, bullet points, and clear formatting to create a readable and scannable guide. Include relevant links to official resources within the text.
