## 💡 Pro Tips
1.  **Customize Platform Examples:** If you want to highlight a different online auction platform than "Everything But The House" (EBTH), simply replace "Everything But The House" with your desired platform (e.g., "MaxSold," "EstateSales.NET's online features," or a local auction house's online portal) throughout the "Marketing & Sales" section.
2.  **Enhance with Specifics:** For an even richer output, consider providing specific (fictional) examples of estate types or item categories in your initial prompt to ground the advice (e.g., "The estate includes a collection of mid-century modern furniture and vintage comic books.").
3.  **Recommended Model:** For the best results regarding nuanced tone, comprehensive coverage, and detailed advice, use a large language model like **GPT-4o**, **Claude 3.5 Sonnet**, or **Gemini 1.5 Pro**.
