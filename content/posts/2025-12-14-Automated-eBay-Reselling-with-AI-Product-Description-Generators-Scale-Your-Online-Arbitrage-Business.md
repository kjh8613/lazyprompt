## 💡 Pro Tips
1.  **Customization:** To get even more tailored product description examples, provide more specific details about the item (e.g., "Used, excellent condition, 2021 model, 44mm Apple Watch Series 7 GPS + Cellular, Midnight aluminum case, with original charger, no box.").
2.  **Keyword Focus:** If you have specific primary and secondary keywords for the blog post itself or for the example product descriptions, include them directly in your prompt's `Task` section for stronger SEO integration.
