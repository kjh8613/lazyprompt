## 💡 Pro Tips
1.  **Customizing Placeholder [ ]**: While this prompt is designed to be self-contained, if you were adapting it for a specific winery beyond "American Legacy Winery," you would replace that placeholder with the actual name. You could also add specific details about the *type* of wine produced or the *region* if known.
2.  **Adding Specific Winery Details**: For even richer content, consider providing the AI with specific details about American Legacy Winery, such as its location, known varietals, founding story, or unique selling propositions. This would allow for a more tailored and compelling narrative.
3.  **Recommended Model**: GPT-4o, Claude 3.5 Sonnet, or Gemini Advanced are recommended for their superior writing, nuance, and ability to adhere to complex instructions.
