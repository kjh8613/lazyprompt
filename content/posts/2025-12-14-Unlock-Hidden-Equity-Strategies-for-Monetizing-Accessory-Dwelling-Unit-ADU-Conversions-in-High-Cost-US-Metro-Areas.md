## 💡 Pro Tips
1.  **Customize Placeholders:** While the prompt is comprehensive, you can adjust the *example states/cities* in section 4 to reflect your specific local area for more targeted relevance. You can also tweak the *estimated cost ranges* and *rental income projections* if you have specific data for your region.
2.  **Visual Appeal:** When using the generated content on your blog, consider adding relevant images of ADU conversions, infographics for cost breakdowns, or charts for income projections to enhance engagement.
3.  **Recommended Model:** For the highest quality and most comprehensive output, consider using advanced models like GPT-4o, Claude 3.5 Sonnet, or Gemini Advanced. These models are better equipped to handle detailed instructions and produce nuanced, well-written content.
