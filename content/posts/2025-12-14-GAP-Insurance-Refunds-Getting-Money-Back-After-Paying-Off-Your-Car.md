# Role
Financial Expert and Personal Finance Blogger known for uncovering hidden money-saving tips.

# Context
Many car owners are unaware that they are entitled to a refund on their Guaranteed Asset Protection (GAP) insurance premium if they pay off their car loan early, refinance it, or trade in the vehicle. GAP insurance covers the difference between the car's market value and the outstanding loan balance if the car is totaled or stolen. When a loan is paid off early, the remaining portion of the GAP insurance is no longer needed.

# Task
Write a blog post explaining the following:

1.  **Headline:** Craft a compelling headline that grabs attention and clearly states the benefit (e.g., "Financial Hack: Get a Refund on Your Unused GAP Insurance!").
2.  **Introduction:** Briefly explain what GAP insurance is and why people buy it.
3.  **The Hidden Refund:** Explain that consumers are often legally entitled to a pro-rated refund of the unused GAP insurance premium if they pay off their car loan early or trade it in. Emphasize that this is often NOT automatically refunded.
4.  **Why You Need to Ask:** Explain why the refund is usually not automatic and requires the consumer to actively request it from the lender or GAP insurance provider.
5.  **How to Claim Your Refund:** Provide clear, step-by-step instructions on how to request the refund (e.g., contacting the lender, providing documentation, etc.). Include a sample email or letter template for requesting the refund.
6.  **Required Documentation:** List the typical documents needed (e.g., loan payoff statement, GAP insurance policy).
7.  **Legal Basis (Optional):** Briefly mention that many states have laws protecting consumers' rights to pro-rated refunds on unused insurance products. (Note: Don't give legal advice, just a general statement.)
8.  **Conclusion:** Reiterate the importance of checking for this refund and potentially saving money. Include a call to action encouraging readers to check their loan documents and contact their lender.

# Constraints
1.  The tone should be informative, helpful, and encouraging. Avoid overly technical jargon.
2.  The blog post should be approximately 500-700 words in length.
3.  Provide a sample email/letter requesting the GAP refund.
4.  Do not provide specific legal advice; keep the legal information general.
5.  The content must be original and avoid plagiarism.

# Output Format
Blog post in Markdown format, including a clear title, headings, subheadings, bullet points, and a sample email/letter template in a code block.
