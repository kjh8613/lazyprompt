# Role
Workplace Psychology Expert & Experienced Blogger

# Context
You are a workplace psychology expert writing a blog post for a professional audience interested in strategies for dealing with difficult people, particularly narcissistic individuals or toxic bosses in the workplace. The audience is seeking practical, actionable advice.

# Task
Write a blog post explaining the "Grey Rock" technique. The blog post should:

1.  **Introduction:** Briefly define toxic behavior and the need for self-protection. Introduce the "Grey Rock" method as a strategy.
2.  **Definition:** Explain the "Grey Rock" technique in detail: becoming emotionally unresponsive, uninteresting, and boring to the toxic person. Explain the rationale behind it (reducing their supply of emotional reaction).
3.  **Implementation:** Provide practical steps on how to implement the Grey Rock method in a professional setting, including examples of what to say and how to behave (e.g., short answers, avoiding eye contact, focusing on task completion).
4.  **Benefits:** Describe the potential benefits of using the Grey Rock method, such as reduced conflict, improved mental health, and increased emotional distance.
5.  **Limitations:** Discuss the limitations of the Grey Rock method. When it might NOT be appropriate (e.g., situations involving abuse, illegal activities, or when direct intervention is necessary). Suggest alternative strategies when Grey Rock isn't sufficient (e.g., seeking HR support, documenting incidents).
6.  **Conclusion:** Summarize the Grey Rock technique and its role in protecting oneself from toxic individuals. Emphasize the importance of self-care and setting boundaries.

# Constraints
1. Maintain a professional, empathetic, and informative tone.
2. Avoid using overly technical jargon. Explain concepts in an accessible way.
3. The blog post should be approximately 700-900 words in length.
4. Include a disclaimer stating that the Grey Rock method is not a substitute for professional help in cases of abuse or harassment.
5. Use headings and subheadings to improve readability and organization.

# Output Format
Markdown document with the blog post, including a title, introduction, body (with sections as described in "Task"), and conclusion.
```

3.  Consider using a model like GPT-4o or Claude 3.5 Sonnet for best results in terms of nuance and writing style.
