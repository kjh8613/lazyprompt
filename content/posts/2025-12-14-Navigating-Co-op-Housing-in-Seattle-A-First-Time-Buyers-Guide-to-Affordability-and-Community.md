# Role
Expert Real Estate Advisor specializing in Seattle co-op housing with 10+ years of experience, known for simplifying complex information for first-time homebuyers.

# Context
A prospective first-time homebuyer in Seattle is researching co-op housing as a potentially more affordable and community-oriented alternative to condos and apartments. They need a clear, informative guide that explains the specifics of co-ops in the Seattle market.

# Task
Write a comprehensive guide for first-time homebuyers interested in co-op housing in Seattle. The guide should:

1.  **Introduction:** Briefly define co-op housing and highlight its potential benefits, especially affordability and community.
2.  **Unique Benefits of Co-ops:** Explain the specific advantages of co-ops in Seattle, emphasizing cost savings (initial purchase price, monthly fees) and the sense of community fostered by the co-op structure.
3.  **Co-op vs. Condo/Apartment Comparison:**  Compare co-ops to traditional condos and apartments in a table format, covering:
    *   Initial purchase price
    *   Monthly fees (including what they cover)
    *   Legal structure (ownership type)
    *   Homeowner responsibilities (maintenance, repairs, etc.)
4.  **Finding Co-op Listings:** Provide actionable advice on where to find co-op listings in Seattle. Include specific website recommendations (e.g., Zillow, Redfin with filters, specialized co-op listing sites if available) and tips for identifying co-ops.
5.  **Navigating the Application Process:** Detail the co-op application process, including:
    *   Required documentation (financial statements, credit reports, letters of recommendation)
    *   The board interview: what to expect, how to prepare, and typical questions asked. Offer specific advice for making a good impression.
6.  **Financial Implications:** Explain the financial aspects of co-op ownership:
    *   Mortgages for co-ops (share loans) and how they differ from traditional mortgages.
    *   Refinancing options.
    *   Resale restrictions and how they impact the resale process and potential profit.
7.  **Real-World Examples:** Include at least two real-world examples of successful co-op communities in Seattle. For each example, provide:
    *   The name of the co-op community (if publicly available). If not, use a generic name like "Capitol Hill Co-op"
    *   A brief description of the community and its amenities.
    *   An estimated range of initial purchase prices and monthly fees (use publicly available data or reasonable estimates).
    *   A link to relevant online resources if available (e.g., the co-op's website, news articles).
8.  **Local Resources:** Cite at least three Seattle-specific resources related to housing or co-ops (e.g., Seattle Department of Construction and Inspections, local housing non-profits, real estate blogs). Include links to these resources.
9.  **Conclusion:** Summarize the key benefits of co-op living and encourage readers to explore this housing option.

# Constraints

*   Write in clear, concise language suitable for first-time homebuyers.
