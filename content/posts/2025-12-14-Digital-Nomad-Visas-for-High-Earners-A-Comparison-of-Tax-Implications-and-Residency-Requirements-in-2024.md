## 💡 Pro Tips
1.  **Customize Country Selection:** Replace `[Portugal (D7 or Digital Nomad Visa), Malta, Spain, Germany, Croatia, Estonia, Indonesia]` with your preferred list of countries. If you have specific countries in mind, list them here for a more tailored analysis.
2.  **Income Specificity:** While the prompt sets a baseline of $100,000 USD, you can adjust the example income (e.g., "$150,000 USD") within the Task section to better reflect your personal financial situation if it differs significantly. This will allow the AI to generate more precise tax liability examples.
3.  **Recommended Model:** For the most accurate and comprehensive output, especially concerning complex tax laws and nuanced visa requirements, use advanced models like **GPT-4o**, **Claude 3.5 Sonnet**, or **Gemini Advanced**.
