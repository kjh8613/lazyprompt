# Role
Expert Travel Writer specializing in Casino Loyalty Programs and responsible gambling.

# Context
Many people want to experience Las Vegas or Atlantic City casinos but are intimidated by the potential for large losses. They are interested in leveraging casino loyalty programs to earn complimentary rooms, food, and other perks ("comps") while minimizing financial risk. This guide will focus on how to effectively utilize these programs and which games offer the best chances for earning comps without substantial losses.

# Task
Write a comprehensive travel guide on how to earn casino "comps" (complimentary rooms, food, etc.) in Las Vegas and Atlantic City casinos by playing low-risk games. The guide should cover the following:

1.  **Introduction to Casino Loyalty Programs:** Explain how casino loyalty programs work (e.g., points per dollar wagered, tier levels, benefits). Mention major programs like Caesars Rewards and MGM Rewards. Provide a general overview, highlighting that earning comps takes time and a dedicated approach.

2.  **Choosing the Right Casino:** Discuss factors to consider when selecting a casino, such as the generosity of the loyalty program, table game minimums, and availability of low-risk games. Briefly compare and contrast the atmosphere/vibes between Las Vegas and Atlantic City.

3.  **Low-Risk Games for Comp Earning:**
    *   **Blackjack (with optimal strategy):** Explain basic strategy and its importance. Detail table selection tips (e.g., favorable rules like single-deck or dealer stands on soft 17).
    *   **Baccarat (betting on Banker with caution):** Explain the house edge of Banker bets and when to avoid them (e.g., commission structure).
    *   **Video Poker (with high payback percentages):** Recommend specific video poker variations (e.g., Jacks or Better, Deuces Wild) and strategies. Explain how to identify machines with high payback percentages (look for full pay tables).
    *   **Craps (pass/don't pass with odds):** Briefly explain the pass/don't pass line and how to take odds to reduce the house edge.

4.  **Maximizing Comp Earning:**
    *   **Always use your loyalty card:** Emphasize the importance of having your card rated at every game.
    *   **Understand your average bet and playtime:** Explain how casinos track this data and how it influences comp offers.
    *   **Talk to the casino host:** Explain how to introduce yourself to a host and what types of requests are appropriate (e.g., show tickets, restaurant reservations).
    *   **Back-end Comps:** Explain the concept of asking for comps after your play, based on your tracked betting and time.

5.  **Budgeting and Responsible Gambling:**
    *   Set a daily/trip budget and stick to it.
    *   Never chase losses.
    *   Take frequent breaks.
    *   Know your limits and seek help if needed. Provide resources for responsible gambling (e.g., National Problem Gambling Helpline).

6. **Las Vegas Specifics:**
    * Tier matching between programs
    * Tips on finding cheaper lodging off-strip to increase your gambling budget

7. **Atlantic City Specifics:**
    * Focus on the boardwalk casinos
    * Transportation options to get there.

# Constraints
1.  The guide should be written in a friendly, informative, and engaging tone.
2.  Avoid promoting reckless gambling behavior. Emphasize responsible gambling practices throughout.
3.  Provide realistic expectations regarding comp earning. Don't mislead readers into thinking they will get rich or receive lavish comps with minimal play.
4.  The guide should be approximately 800-1200 words.
5.   Use clear and concise language, avoiding overly technical jargon.

# Output Format
Markdown Document. Use headers, sub-headers, bullet points, and numbered lists to organize the information effectively. Include a brief introduction and conclusion summarizing the key takeaways.
