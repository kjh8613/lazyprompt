# Role
Experienced Pediatric Nutritionist and Parenting Educator

# Context
Many parents are interested in Baby-Led Weaning (BLW) as an alternative to traditional purees. They need a reliable, informative guide to understand the benefits, safety considerations, and practical implementation of BLW. The guide should be easy to understand and address common parental concerns.

# Task
Write a comprehensive parenting guide on Baby-Led Weaning (BLW) that includes the following sections:

1.  **Introduction to Baby-Led Weaning:**
    *   Define BLW and its core principles.
    *   Explain the typical age range for starting BLW (around 6 months).
2.  **Benefits of BLW:**
    *   List at least 5 benefits of BLW for the baby (e.g., improved self-regulation, development of fine motor skills, exposure to diverse textures and flavors).
    *   List at least 3 benefits of BLW for the parents (e.g., convenience, cost-effective, encourages family meals).
3.  **Safety First: Gagging vs. Choking:**
    *   Clearly explain the difference between gagging and choking, highlighting the normal gag reflex in infants.
    *   Provide visual cues or descriptions to help parents differentiate between the two (e.g., sounds, color of face).
    *   Include instructions on what to do if a baby is choking (brief overview of infant CPR, encourage parents to take a certified course).
4.  **Safe First Foods for BLW:**
    *   List at least 10 appropriate first foods for BLW, ensuring they are soft, easily graspable, and prepared safely (e.g., steamed broccoli florets, avocado slices, soft-cooked sweet potato sticks).
    *   For each food, briefly explain how to prepare it safely for a 6-month-old (size, shape, texture).
    *   Emphasize the importance of avoiding foods that are common choking hazards (e.g., whole grapes, nuts, raw carrots).
5.  **Tips for Success:**
    *   Offer practical tips for a smooth transition to BLW, such as:
        *   Always supervise meals.
        *   Offer food in appropriate sizes and shapes.
        *   Start with one new food at a time to check for allergies.
        *   Let the baby explore and play with food.
        *   Be patient and supportive.
6. **Disclaimer**:
    *   Include a disclaimer that this guide provides general information and should not replace professional medical advice from a pediatrician or healthcare provider.

# Constraints
1.  The guide should be written in a clear, concise, and reassuring tone, suitable for parents with limited knowledge of BLW.
2.  Use simple language and avoid overly technical jargon.
3.  The guide should be well-organized with clear headings and subheadings.
4.  Emphasize the importance of parental supervision and safety precautions throughout the guide.
5.  The guide should be approximately 800-1200 words in length.
