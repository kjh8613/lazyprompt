# Task
Write a consumer protection guide titled "Lemon Laws: Your Rights When You Buy a Defective New Car." The guide must include the following sections:

1.  **Introduction:** Briefly explain what Lemon Laws are and their purpose.
2.  **What Vehicles Are Covered?** Define which types of vehicles are typically covered under Lemon Laws (e.g., new cars, trucks, SUVs, motorcycles; leased vehicles). Mention exclusions, if any (e.g., used cars, commercial vehicles).
3.  **What Qualifies as a "Lemon"?** Detail the criteria a vehicle must meet to be considered a lemon. Include specific examples of "substantial defects" (e.g., engine problems, brake failures, electrical issues). Explain the importance of documentation and repair records.
4.  **Repair Attempt Requirements:** Explain the repair attempt requirements that must be met before a buyer can claim a lemon. For example, specify criteria like:
    *   The number of repair attempts for the *same* defect (e.g., "3 or 4 attempts").

    *   Whether the defect persists *after* these attempts.

    *   Notifying the manufacturer of the defect and repair history.

    *   Considering arbitration or legal action.
7.  **State-Specific Variations:** Briefly mention that Lemon Laws vary by state, and it's important to consult with an attorney in their specific state.
8.  **Conclusion:** Reiterate the importance of knowing one's rights when purchasing a new vehicle.
