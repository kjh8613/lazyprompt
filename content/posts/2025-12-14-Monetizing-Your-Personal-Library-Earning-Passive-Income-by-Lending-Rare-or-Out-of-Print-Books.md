2.  **Why Lend Rare Books?** Briefly explain the unique market for rare/out-of-print books and why lending them is a viable business model (e.g., accessibility for researchers, enthusiasts, high rental value).
3.  **Choosing Your Lending Platform:**
    *   **Online Platforms:** Discuss dedicated book lending/rental sites (e.g., specialized academic/niche platforms if they exist, or conceptualizing one), peer-to-peer marketplaces, online forums for collectors, and leveraging social media groups (Facebook, Reddit).

4.  **Protecting Your Priceless Collection:**

5.  **Pricing Your Rentals Competitively:**

11. **Interview Snippets:** Integrate 2-3 short, fictional interview snippets from successful lenders. Each snippet should offer a unique piece of advice, a challenge overcome, or a successful strategy (e.g., "The key for me was building trust within a niche academic community," or "Initially, I underestimated the importance of professional photography.").
