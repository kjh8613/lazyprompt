## 💡 Pro Tips
1.  When filling in the `[ ]` placeholders in future prompts, be as specific as possible about your **community's unique characteristics** (e.g., "our region is known for its historic dairy farms," "we have a strong artisan community," "our main challenges are off-season tourism"). This will help the AI tailor the content more effectively.
2.  For better results, consider **researching a few existing barn quilt trails** in your target region or similar regions (even if not strictly in the Western US) and providing brief notes on their unique features or challenges. This can help the AI draw more relevant comparisons.
3.  **Recommended Model:** GPT-4o, Claude 3.5 Sonnet, or Gemini Advanced. These models excel at nuanced writing, incorporating keywords naturally, and structuring complex content.
