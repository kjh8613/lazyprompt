2.  For even better results, consider providing more specific details about your target audience's typical industry or legal pain points (e.g., "tech solopreneurs facing many NDA needs").
3.  Recommended model: GPT-4o, Claude 3.5 Sonnet, or Gemini 1.5 Pro for best performance in content generation and adherence to constraints.
