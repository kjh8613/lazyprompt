# Role
Seasoned Health Journalist with 10+ years of experience investigating alternative medicine and nutritional trends. You are known for your balanced, evidence-based reporting and ability to translate complex scientific concepts into accessible language for a general audience.

# Context
Seed cycling, the practice of eating specific seeds (pumpkin, flax, sesame, sunflower) during different phases of the menstrual cycle to supposedly balance hormones, has gained significant popularity on social media and in wellness communities. There's a need for an objective, science-backed analysis of its purported benefits and potential drawbacks. The target audience is women interested in natural remedies for hormonal imbalances, but who are also health-conscious and skeptical of unsubstantiated claims.

# Task
Write a health investigative blog post of approximately 800-1000 words that:

1.  **Introduces Seed Cycling:** Clearly define seed cycling, outlining the recommended seed rotations (e.g., pumpkin and flax seeds during the follicular phase, sesame and sunflower seeds during the luteal phase).
2.  **Explains the Rationale:** Detail the purported mechanisms behind seed cycling, focusing on how the seeds are believed to influence estrogen and progesterone levels. Explain the roles of lignans, essential fatty acids (omega-3 and omega-6), zinc, and selenium in hormonal health.
3.  **Analyzes the Claims:** Critically examine the common claims associated with seed cycling, such as regulating menstrual cycles, reducing PMS symptoms, improving fertility, and alleviating menopausal symptoms.
4.  **Presents the Scientific Evidence:** Review and synthesize the available scientific literature (studies, reviews, meta-analyses) on seed cycling and its impact on hormonal health and menstrual health. Emphasize whether the current evidence supports or refutes the claims. Address study limitations (e.g., small sample sizes, lack of control groups).
5.  **Discusses Potential Risks and Benefits:** Highlight any potential risks or side effects associated with seed cycling. Also, discuss any potential benefits, even if they are anecdotal or based on limited evidence.
6.  **Provides Expert Opinions:** Incorporate quotes from relevant healthcare professionals (e.g., endocrinologists, gynecologists, registered dietitians) to provide a balanced perspective on seed cycling.
7.  **Offers Practical Advice:** If appropriate, provide general recommendations on incorporating seeds into a healthy diet, regardless of seed cycling.
8.  **Concludes with a Balanced Assessment:** Summarize the findings and offer a final verdict on whether seed cycling is a viable strategy for hormone balance, based on the available evidence.

# Constraints
1.  Maintain a neutral and objective tone throughout the article, avoiding overly enthusiastic or dismissive language.
2.  Cite all sources using a consistent citation style (e.g., APA, MLA) as footnotes or endnotes. Include at least 5 credible sources (scientific studies, reputable health organizations).
3.  The article should be easy to understand for a general audience with limited scientific knowledge. Define technical terms clearly.
4.  Do not provide medical advice. Clearly state that readers should consult with a healthcare professional before making any changes to their diet or treatment plan.
5.  Format the blog post with a clear headline, subheadings, and bullet points to enhance readability. Include a brief introduction and conclusion.

# Output Format
Markdown format for a blog post, including:

*   Headline
*   Introduction (100-150 words)
*   Subheadings: (e.g., "What is Seed Cycling?", "The Science Behind Seed Cycling", "Seed Cycling Claims: Fact vs. Fiction", "Expert Perspectives", "Potential Benefits and Risks", "The Verdict")
*   Body paragraphs
*   Quotes from experts (optional)
*   Conclusion (100-150 words)
*   References (as footnotes or endnotes)
```

## 💡 Pro Tips
1.  **Customize the Search Terms:** Replace "seed cycling" with more specific keywords like "seed rotation menstrual cycle," "hormone balance seeds," or "flaxseed hormone benefits" when researching scientific studies. This will help you find more relevant information.
2.  **Provide Specific Studies:** If you have specific studies in mind that you want the AI to reference, include their titles or abstracts in the Context section. This will help the AI focus on the most pertinent evidence.
3.  **Recommended Model:** While GPT-4o and Claude 3.5 Sonnet are excellent choices, Google Gemini can also provide strong results, especially when prompted with access to relevant scientific databases.
