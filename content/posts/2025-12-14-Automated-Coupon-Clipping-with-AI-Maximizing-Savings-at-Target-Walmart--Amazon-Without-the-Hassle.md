## 💡 Pro Tips
1.  **Customizing Tools:** When the AI lists specific tools, you can replace them with your personal favorites or the most popular ones you know. Simply update the bracketed placeholders `[Tool Name]` and `[Tool Functionality]`.
2.  **Adding Real Data:** For even better results, before or after generating, find real-world examples of a specific product's price drop at Target, Walmart, or Amazon due to a coupon. You can then ask the AI to integrate these specific examples into the "Real Example Description" sections.
3.  **Recommended Model:** For the best balance of creativity, detail, and adherence to instructions, use **GPT-4o**, **Claude 3.5 Sonnet**, or **Gemini Advanced**.
