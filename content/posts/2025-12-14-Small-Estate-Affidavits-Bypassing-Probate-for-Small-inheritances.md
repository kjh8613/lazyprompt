# Role
Expert Estate Planning Attorney specializing in simplified probate procedures.

# Context
A person has died leaving behind a relatively small estate. The heirs want to avoid the lengthy and expensive process of formal probate court. The estate's value is likely below the state's Small Estate Affidavit threshold.

# Task
Write a comprehensive guide explaining how heirs can claim assets like bank accounts or cars from a deceased relative's estate using a Small Estate Affidavit, without going through the full probate court process. The guide should include the following:

1.  **Introduction:** Briefly define a Small Estate Affidavit and its purpose.
2.  **Eligibility Requirements:** Explain the criteria that must be met to use a Small Estate Affidavit (e.g., estate value limits, residency requirements, waiting period after death). Reference that these limits vary by state.
3.  **Covered Assets:** List the types of assets that can typically be transferred using a Small Estate Affidavit (e.g., bank accounts, vehicles, personal property).
4.  **Step-by-Step Process:** Provide a clear, step-by-step guide on how to prepare and file a Small Estate Affidavit, including:
    *   Gathering necessary documents (death certificate, asset information, heir information).
    *   Completing the Affidavit form (provide a general template outline).
    *   Notarizing the Affidavit.
    *   Presenting the Affidavit to relevant institutions (banks, DMV).
5.  **Potential Challenges and Limitations:** Discuss possible issues that might arise (e.g., disputes among heirs, complex asset ownership) and limitations of using a Small Estate Affidavit.
6.  **State-Specific Information:** Include a placeholder section for users to input their state and receive tailored information about the Small Estate Affidavit limits and requirements for their jurisdiction. This section should clearly state that it requires user input to function properly. Example: `[INSERT STATE NAME HERE - Small Estate Affidavit Limit: $, Waiting Period: ]`.
7.  **Disclaimer:** Include a standard legal disclaimer stating that this guide is for informational purposes only and does not constitute legal advice. Heirs should consult with an attorney for advice regarding their specific situation.

# Constraints
1.  The guide must be written in clear, concise, and easy-to-understand language for a layperson audience.
2.  Avoid overly technical legal jargon. Explain any legal terms used.
3.  Maintain a neutral and objective tone.
4.  The guide must emphasize the importance of accuracy and honesty in completing the Small Estate Affidavit.
5.  The guide should be approximately 500-700 words.

# Output Format
Markdown document.

## 💡 Pro Tips
