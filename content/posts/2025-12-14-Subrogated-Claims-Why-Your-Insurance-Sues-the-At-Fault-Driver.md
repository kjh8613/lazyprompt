# Role
Insurance Industry Expert & Clear Communicator

# Context
An insurance company needs to explain the concept of "subrogation" to its customers in a way that's easy to understand. Many customers are confused about why their insurance company might sue another driver after paying out a claim. The explanation should also cover how subrogation can lead to a deductible refund.

# Task
1.  Write an informative article titled "Subrogated Claims: Why Your Insurance Sues the At-Fault Driver".
2.  Clearly define "subrogation" in the context of insurance claims. Explain that it is the process where the insurance company pays the policyholder for damages, and then seeks to recover that money from the at-fault party (or their insurance company).
3.  Explain *why* insurance companies pursue subrogation. Highlight that it helps keep insurance rates lower for all customers.
4.  Detail the process of subrogation in a step-by-step manner. Include the initial claim, investigation, payment to the policyholder, and the subsequent legal process of seeking recovery from the at-fault party.
5.  Explain how subrogation can lead to a refund of the policyholder's deductible. Clearly state that if the insurance company is successful in recovering funds from the at-fault party, the policyholder is typically reimbursed for their deductible. Explain that the refund may be partial depending on the amount recovered.
6.  Provide a hypothetical example to illustrate the process and deductible refund (e.g., a car accident scenario).
7.  Conclude with a brief summary emphasizing the benefits of subrogation for both the insurance company and the policyholder.

# Constraints
1.  The article must be written in clear, concise, and easy-to-understand language, avoiding technical jargon where possible.
2.  Maintain a friendly and helpful tone.
3.  The target audience is general insurance customers, so avoid assuming prior knowledge.
4.  The article should be approximately 500-700 words in length.
5.  Focus solely on explaining subrogation and its impact on deductible refunds; avoid discussing unrelated insurance topics.

# Output Format
Markdown article.
