# Context
Many homeowners are unaware of the IRS Section 121 Exclusion, which allows them to exclude a significant amount of capital gains from the sale of their primary residence, potentially saving them thousands of dollars in taxes. This guide aims to demystify this exclusion.

# Task
Create a comprehensive and easy-to-understand financial tax guide explaining the IRS Section 121 Exclusion, including the following:

1.  **Introduction:** Briefly explain what the Section 121 Exclusion is and its potential benefits.
2.  **Basic Requirements (Ownership and Use Test):**
    *   Clearly define the "ownership test" (owned the home for at least two years during the five-year period ending on the date of sale).
    *   Clearly define the "use test" (lived in the home as your primary residence for at least two years during the five-year period ending on the date of sale).
    *   Explain the difference between "owned" and "lived in."
    *   Provide examples illustrating scenarios that meet and do not meet the ownership and use tests.
3.  **Exclusion Amounts:**
    *   State the maximum exclusion amount for single filers ($250,000).
    *   State the maximum exclusion amount for married couples filing jointly ($500,000).
4.  **Exceptions to the Two-Year Rule (Partial Exclusion):**
    *   Explain circumstances that may qualify for a partial exclusion (e.g., job change, health issues, unforeseen circumstances).
    *   Explain how to calculate the partial exclusion (pro-rating the exclusion based on the time of ownership and use).
    *   Provide examples.
5.  **Special Situations:**
    *   Briefly address special situations, such as:
        *   Homes acquired in a divorce.
        *   Homes inherited.
        *   Homes used partly for business (e.g., home office).
        *   Homes owned by expatriates.
6.  **Record Keeping:** Emphasize the importance of maintaining records related to home improvements, purchase price, and sale expenses.
7.  **How to Report the Sale:** Briefly explain how to report the sale on your tax return (Form 8949 and Schedule D).
8.  **Disclaimer:** Include a standard disclaimer stating that this is for informational purposes only and not financial or legal advice, and that individuals should consult with a qualified professional.
