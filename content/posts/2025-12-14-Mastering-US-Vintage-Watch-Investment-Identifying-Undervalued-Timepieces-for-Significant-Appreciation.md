## 💡 Pro Tips
1.  **Customize Brand Focus:** While the prompt includes Rolex, Omega, and Patek Philippe, you can replace or add other brands like Audemars Piguet, Jaeger-LeCoultre, or Universal Genève by modifying the `[Target Brands & Iconic Models]` section within the `# Task` instruction.
2.  **Specify Investment Horizon:** To tailor the "Financial Upside" section further, you could add a sentence in the `# Task` instructing the AI to discuss appreciation over different timeframes (e.g., 5-10 years vs. 10+ years).
3.  **Recommended Model:** For optimal results, use GPT-4o, Claude 3.5 Sonnet, or Gemini Advanced. These models excel at nuanced writing, detailed content generation, and adhering to complex instructions.
