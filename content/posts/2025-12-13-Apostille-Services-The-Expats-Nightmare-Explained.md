# Role
Expert Bureaucratic Guide Writer specializing in international legal document authentication.

# Context
Many expats encounter difficulties understanding and navigating the Apostille process when needing to use official documents (like birth or marriage certificates) in a foreign country. A clear, easy-to-understand guide is required to demystify this process and prevent common errors.

# Task
Write a comprehensive guide titled "Apostille Services: The Expat's Nightmare Explained." The guide should include the following sections, addressing them thoroughly:

1.  **What is an Apostille?** Define an Apostille clearly and concisely. Explain its purpose and legal basis (Hague Convention).
2.  **Why Notarization Isn't Enough:** Explain why a simple notarization is insufficient for international use. Detail the limitations of notarization in a global context.
3.  **Authenticating Birth and Marriage Certificates (The Process):** Provide a step-by-step guide on how to authenticate birth and marriage certificates for international use. This should include:
    *   Identifying the correct issuing authority for the Apostille (e.g., Secretary of State, competent authority based on jurisdiction).
    *   Explaining document requirements (e.g., certified copy, original document).
    *   Describing the application process (online, mail, in-person).
    *   Providing examples of acceptable and unacceptable documents.
    *   Including approximate costs and processing times (with a disclaimer that these can vary).
4.  **Common Mistakes to Avoid:** List 5-7 common mistakes expats make when seeking an Apostille, such as using the wrong type of copy, applying to the incorrect authority, or not providing sufficient identification.
5.  **Resources:** Provide links to official government websites and resources related to Apostille services in [Country - e.g., United States]. Also mention the Hague Convention website.

# Constraints
1.  The tone must be informative, clear, concise, and helpful, targeting an expat audience with limited prior knowledge of Apostille services.
2.  Avoid legal jargon where possible. When unavoidable, define terms clearly.
3.  The guide must be accurate and reflect current procedures. Provide disclaimers where information is subject to change.
4.  The guide should be approximately 800-1200 words in length.
5.  Present the information in a well-structured and easy-to-navigate format, using headings, subheadings, bullet points, and numbered lists where appropriate.

# Output Format
Markdown document.

## 💡 Pro Tips
1.  Customize the "[Country - e.g., United States]" placeholder with the specific country you want the guide to focus on. This will ensure the resource links and information about issuing authorities are relevant. You can also add a section for a second country.
2.  If you have specific state or provincial requirements in mind (e.g., California birth certificates), you can add this to the context to make the instructions more targeted.
3.  Recommended model: GPT-4o or Claude 3.5 Sonnet for their strong factual accuracy and ability to generate clear, well-organized guides. Double-check all legal information against official sources.
