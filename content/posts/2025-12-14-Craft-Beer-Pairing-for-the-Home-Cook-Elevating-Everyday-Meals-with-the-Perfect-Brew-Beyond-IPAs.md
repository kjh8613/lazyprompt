# Role
World-Class Food & Beverage Blogger with extensive knowledge in craft beer and culinary arts.

# Context
The user is a home cook who enjoys preparing common meals but wants to enhance their dining experience by pairing them with craft beer. They are looking for practical, accessible advice that goes beyond the ubiquitous IPA pairings. The goal is to provide a comprehensive guide that educates and inspires, making beer and food pairing an enjoyable and approachable part of home cooking.

# Task
Write a blog post titled "Craft Beer Pairing for the Home Cook: Elevating Everyday Meals with the Perfect Brew (Beyond IPAs)". The blog post should:
1.  **Introduce** the concept of craft beer and food pairing, emphasizing its ability to elevate everyday meals.
2.  **Explain** the core principles of beer and food pairing, including:
    *   Complementing flavors (e.g., matching malty beer with roasted meats).
    *   Contrasting flavors (e.g., using a bitter beer to cut through rich, fatty food).
    *   Cutting richness (e.g., carbonation and acidity cleansing the palate).
3.  **Explore** a variety of craft beer styles beyond IPAs, such as:
    *   Lagers (Pilsners, Helles)
    *   Stouts (Milk Stouts, Imperial Stouts)
    *   Saisons
    *   Wheat Beers (Hefeweizens, Witbiers)
    *   Belgian Ales (Dubbels, Tripels)
4.  **Provide specific, actionable beer pairing recommendations** for common home-cooked meals. For each meal, suggest 1-2 specific beer styles and explain *why* they work based on the pairing principles. Include at least the following:
    *   **Pizza:** (e.g., Pepperoni, Margherita)
    *   **Pasta:** (e.g., Creamy Alfredo, Tomato-based Bolognese)
    *   **Grilled Chicken:** (e.g., Lemon Herb, BBQ)
    *   **Hearty Stews/Chili:**
    *   **Vegetarian Meals:** (e.g., Veggie Burgers, Roasted Vegetables)
    *   **Seafood Dishes:** (e.g., Fried Fish, Shrimp Scampi)
5.  **Offer practical tips** for home cooks to experiment and discover their own pairings.
6.  **Conclude** with an encouraging statement about the joy of pairing craft beer with home-cooked food.

# Constraints
1.  **Tone:** Enthusiastic, educational, accessible, and encouraging for home cooks. Avoid overly technical jargon where possible, or explain it simply.
2.  **Focus:** Strongly emphasize pairings *beyond* IPAs. While IPAs can be mentioned briefly as a common go-to, the bulk of the recommendations must feature other styles.
3.  **Practicality:** Suggestions should be for readily available craft beer styles and common home-cooked dishes.
4.  **Structure:** The blog post should have a clear introduction, body sections explaining principles and providing recommendations, and a conclusion. Use headings and bullet points for readability.
5.  **Word Count:** Aim for approximately 800-1200 words.

# Output Format
A well-structured blog post in Markdown format, ready for publication.

## 💡 Pro Tips
1.  When customizing the prompt, consider adding or substituting specific meals and their variations (e.g., "spicy tacos" instead of just "tacos," or "pan-seared salmon" instead of general "seafood dishes") for even more tailored pairings.
2.  For deeper dives, you can ask the AI to explain the flavor profiles of specific beer styles in more detail or provide alternative beer suggestions for each meal.
3.  **Recommended Model:** GPT-4o, Claude 3.5 Sonnet, or Gemini Advanced for nuanced writing and comprehensive understanding.
