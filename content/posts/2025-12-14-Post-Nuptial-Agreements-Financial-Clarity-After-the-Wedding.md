# Role
Expert Relationship Law Attorney specializing in marital agreements and asset division.

# Context
Many married couples find themselves facing financial uncertainties and disagreements, especially when a business is started during the marriage or unforeseen circumstances arise. Post-nuptial agreements offer a way to address these issues after the wedding has taken place. The goal is to provide clear information and guidance to couples considering or creating a post-nuptial agreement.

# Task
Write a comprehensive relationship law guide on post-nuptial agreements, covering the following points:

1.  **Introduction:** Begin with a concise introduction explaining what a post-nuptial agreement is.
2.  **Why Create a Post-Nup?**  Explain the common reasons married couples choose to create post-nuptial agreements. Provide at least five distinct reasons.
3.  **Asset Division and Business Ownership:** Dedicate a section to explaining how post-nuptial agreements can be particularly useful in defining asset division, especially when one or both spouses start a business during the marriage.  Provide hypothetical examples of how the agreement might address business valuation, ownership, and future profits.
4.  **Financial Stress Reduction:** Elaborate on how a post-nuptial agreement can alleviate financial stress within a marriage by providing clarity and certainty regarding finances.
5.  **Key Considerations:** Outline key considerations for creating a valid and enforceable post-nuptial agreement. This should include the importance of independent legal counsel, full financial disclosure, and fairness.
6.  **Conclusion:** Summarize the benefits of post-nuptial agreements and encourage couples to seek professional legal advice if considering one.

# Constraints
1.  The guide should be written in clear, concise, and easy-to-understand language, avoiding legal jargon where possible.
2.  Maintain a neutral and objective tone, presenting both the advantages and potential drawbacks of post-nuptial agreements.
3.  The guide should be approximately 800-1200 words in length.
4.  Ensure the information provided is accurate and reflects current legal practices regarding post-nuptial agreements.
5.  Do not provide legal advice specific to any jurisdiction. Instead, provide general guidance applicable across various jurisdictions.

# Output Format
Markdown document.

## 💡 Pro Tips
1. Tailor the "Context" section with specific scenarios or situations you want the guide to address. This will help the AI focus on relevant information. For example, if you have a specific state in mind (though the instructions prohibit specific legal advice), mentioning common business types in that state can help shape the examples.
2. Consider adding "Examples" within the "Task" section to guide the AI on the level of detail expected for the hypothetical scenarios. For example, request that business valuation scenarios involve "Discounted Cash Flow" or "Market Multiple" analysis (while ensuring the overall tone remains accessible).
3.  Experiment with different "Role" assignments, such as "Certified Financial Planner specializing in divorce" or "Relationship Counselor with legal training" to see how the tone and emphasis of the guide change. Recommended model: GPT-4o.
