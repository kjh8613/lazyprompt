# Role
Cybersecurity Expert & Technical Writer

# Context
Many individuals and organizations still rely on SMS-based two-factor authentication (2FA) for securing their accounts. However, SMS 2FA is increasingly vulnerable to sophisticated attacks, particularly "SIM swapping."  There's a need for clear, accessible information explaining the risks of SMS 2FA and promoting the adoption of more secure alternatives, specifically hardware security keys like YubiKey. Target audience is tech-savvy individuals and small business owners looking to improve their cybersecurity posture.

# Task
Write a cybersecurity guide with the following structure:

1.  **Introduction:** Briefly introduce the importance of two-factor authentication (2FA) in securing online accounts.

2.  **The Illusion of Security: SMS 2FA and Its Weaknesses:**
    *   Explain how SMS 2FA works.
    *   Clearly define "SIM swapping" and how it's executed by attackers.
    *   Detail the risks associated with SIM swapping: account takeover, financial loss, identity theft.
    *   Explain why SMS is inherently insecure (e.g., unencrypted transmission, reliance on telecom providers).

3.  **The Gold Standard: Hardware Security Keys (YubiKey):**
    *   Introduce hardware security keys (like YubiKey) as a more secure alternative to SMS 2FA.
    *   Explain how hardware security keys work, emphasizing their physical security and resistance to phishing attacks.
    *   Highlight the benefits of hardware security keys: strong authentication, protection against phishing, ease of use.
    *   Describe different types of hardware security keys and their compatibility with various services (email, crypto exchanges, etc.).

4.  **Step-by-Step Guide: Securing Your Accounts with a YubiKey:**
    *   Provide clear, concise instructions on how to set up a YubiKey for common services like Google, email providers, and crypto exchanges.  Include links to relevant resources.

5.  **Conclusion:** Reiterate the importance of strong authentication and encourage readers to adopt hardware security keys.  Include a call to action to research and purchase a hardware security key.

# Constraints
*   **Tone:** Informative, persuasive, and easy to understand for a tech-savvy audience. Avoid overly technical jargon.
*   **Length:** The guide should be approximately 700-900 words.
*   **Accuracy:** Ensure all technical information is accurate and up-to-date. Cite sources where appropriate.
*   **Focus:** Maintain a focus on the specific vulnerabilities of SMS 2FA and the benefits of hardware security keys.
*   **No Scaremongering:** Avoid using overly alarmist language.  Present the information in a balanced and objective manner.

# Output Format
Markdown document.  Use headings and subheadings to clearly structure the content. Include bullet points for lists and step-by-step instructions.  Include relevant external links where appropriate.

## 💡 Pro Tips
1.  Customize the "Step-by-Step Guide" section by specifying particular services (e.g., Gmail, Coinbase, LastPass) you want instructions for. The more specific you are, the better the AI can tailor the guide.
2.  Provide links to reputable sources on SIM swapping and hardware security keys to improve the accuracy and credibility of the output.  This helps the AI understand the current threat landscape and best practices.
3.  Recommended models: GPT-4o, Claude 3.5 Sonnet, Gemini 1.5 Pro. These models are generally good at writing informative guides and technical content.
