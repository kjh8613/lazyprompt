## 💡 Pro Tips
1.  **Customization:** You can adjust the target word count or emphasize specific sections by modifying the `Length` and detail within the `Task` description. For instance, if you want more detail on "Sourcing Rare Ingredients," you could add a sub-point like "Highlight specific regions known for quality ingredients."
2.  **Target Audience Refinement:** To tailor the output further, consider specifying the *exact* type of entrepreneur you envision (e.g., "someone with a background in chemistry," "a creative artist," "a business professional looking for a lifestyle shift"). This could be added to the `Context`.
3.  **Recommended Model:** GPT-4o or Claude 3.5 Sonnet are recommended for their advanced language understanding, creative writing capabilities, and ability to adhere to complex instructions.
