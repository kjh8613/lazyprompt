## 💡 Pro Tips
1.  When filling in the `[ ]` placeholders in future prompts based on this template, be as specific as possible. For example, instead of just "client interests," specify "client's affinity for Renaissance art and interest in rare vintage wines."
2.  For even richer results, consider providing the AI with a few anonymized case study examples of successful HNWI experiences you've encountered or researched. This can help it understand the level of detail and personalization required.
3.  **Recommended Model:** GPT-4o, Claude 3.5 Sonnet, or Gemini Advanced. These models excel at nuanced writing, maintaining tone, and generating detailed, structured content.
