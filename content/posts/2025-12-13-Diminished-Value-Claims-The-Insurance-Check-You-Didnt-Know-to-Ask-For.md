# Role
Expert Automotive Insurance Guide Writer with 15 years of experience, specializing in consumer education and legal compliance.

# Context
You are writing a comprehensive guide for car owners who have been involved in a not-at-fault accident. The guide aims to inform them about "diminished value claims," a relatively unknown aspect of insurance settlements, and empower them to pursue rightful compensation. Assume the target audience has limited knowledge of insurance law.

# Task
1.  **Introduction:** Start with an engaging introduction highlighting the problem: Many car owners only focus on repair costs after an accident and are unaware of the potential loss in resale value due to the car's accident history.
2.  **Explain Diminished Value:** Define "diminished value" in simple, easy-to-understand terms. Explain that even after repairs, a car that has been in an accident is worth less than a comparable car that hasn't.
3.  **Eligibility Criteria:** Clearly outline the criteria for filing a diminished value claim. This includes:
    *   Being not-at-fault for the accident.
    *   Having the car properly repaired.
    *   The accident being documented and reported.
4.  **Types of Diminished Value:** Briefly explain the different types (Inherent, Repair-Related, and Appraisal-Related) with focus on Inherent Diminished Value.
5.  **How to File a Claim:** Provide a step-by-step guide on how to file a diminished value claim, including:
    *   Gathering evidence (accident report, repair estimates, photos, car's pre-accident value).
    *   Contacting the at-fault driver's insurance company.
    *   Obtaining an independent appraisal from a qualified appraiser.
    *   Negotiating with the insurance adjuster.
    *   Considering legal recourse if the claim is denied.
6.  **Example Calculation:** Include a simplified example illustrating how diminished value is typically calculated (e.g., using a percentage of the car's pre-accident value).
7.  **State Variations:** Acknowledge that diminished value claim laws vary by state, and encourage readers to research the specific laws in their state.
8.  **Benefits of Filing:** Emphasize the benefits of pursuing a diminished value claim, such as recouping financial losses and protecting resale value.
9.  **Conclusion:** Summarize the key takeaways and encourage readers to take action if they are eligible for a claim.
10. **Disclaimer:** Include a clear disclaimer stating that this guide is for informational purposes only and does not constitute legal advice. Readers should consult with a qualified attorney for specific legal guidance.

# Constraints
1.  Use clear, concise, and easy-to-understand language. Avoid jargon.
2.  Maintain a neutral and informative tone.
3.  The guide should be approximately 800-1200 words in length.
4.  The content must be accurate and factually correct.
5.  Format the guide with clear headings, subheadings, and bullet points for easy readability.

# Output Format
Markdown document structured as a comprehensive automotive insurance guide.
```

## 💡 Pro Tips
1.  Customize the "Example Calculation" section with real-world scenarios and dollar amounts to make it more relatable for the reader.
2.  Research and incorporate state-specific examples or references to enhance the guide's relevance for readers in different locations. You can add placeholders like "[Your State]" to prompt for this information.
3.  Recommended model: GPT-4o, Claude 3.5 Sonnet. Using models with stronger writing capabilities will produce a more polished and informative guide.
