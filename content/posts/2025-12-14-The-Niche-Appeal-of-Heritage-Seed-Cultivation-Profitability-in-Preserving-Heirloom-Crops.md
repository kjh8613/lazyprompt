## 💡 Pro Tips

1.  **Customize [ ] Placeholders:** While this prompt is designed to be ready-to-go, you can enhance the results by adding specific Western US regions or climates in the context if you have a particular focus (e.g., "particularly relevant for gardeners in the arid Southwest," or "adapting to the diverse microclimates of the Pacific Northwest").
2.  **Elaborate on Specific Crops:** For even richer content, consider asking the AI to "provide 3-5 specific examples of heirloom vegetables and their unique market appeal, including their origin stories and flavor profiles" in a follow-up prompt or by slightly modifying the "Task" section.
3.  **Recommended Model:** GPT-4o, Claude 3.5 Sonnet, or Gemini Advanced are recommended for their sophisticated writing capabilities and ability to follow complex instructions.
