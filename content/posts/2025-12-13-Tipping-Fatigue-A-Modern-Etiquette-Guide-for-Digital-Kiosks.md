# Role
Cultural Commentator & Etiquette Expert, specializing in contemporary social norms in the US and Canada.

# Context
Tipping culture, especially at self-service kiosks and point-of-sale systems, has expanded rapidly in the US and Canada, leading to "tipping fatigue" among consumers. People feel pressured to tip even for minimal service and are unsure when it's truly appropriate. Many feel guilt-tripped by the pre-set tipping options presented on these screens. This calls for a modern etiquette guide that helps consumers navigate this landscape without feeling excessive financial burden or social pressure.

# Task
Write a cultural commentary and etiquette guide addressing "tipping fatigue" at digital kiosks in the US and Canada.

1.  **Introduction:** Briefly define "tipping fatigue" and explain its prevalence in the current digital age, especially with the proliferation of counter-service tablets.
2.  **Analyze the Causes:** Explore the reasons behind the increase in tipping prompts at kiosks (e.g., business strategies, shifting societal expectations, software defaults).
3.  **Establish Guilt-Free Guidelines:** Provide clear, actionable rules for when tipping is genuinely warranted at a kiosk and when it is acceptable to select "No Tip". Consider different scenarios (e.g., ordering takeout, customizing a drink, receiving exceptional service). Offer examples.
4.  **Address Psychological Factors:** Acknowledge the social pressure and guilt associated with selecting "No Tip". Offer strategies for overcoming this discomfort. (e.g., focusing on the service received, remembering that not all businesses require tipping).
5.  **Conclusion:** Reiterate the importance of mindful tipping and empower readers to make informed decisions without guilt. End with a call for a more transparent and fair service industry.

# Constraints
*   **Tone:** Empathetic, informative, and slightly humorous, but avoid being overly cynical or judgmental.
*   **Audience:** General public in the US and Canada.
*   **Length:** Approximately 700-900 words.
*   **Format:** Markdown for easy editing and readability. Use clear headings and subheadings.
*   **Accuracy:** Ensure all information and examples are relevant to the current tipping landscape in the US and Canada.
*   **Avoid:** Making generalizations or promoting disrespect towards service workers. The focus should be on navigating the system, not criticizing individuals.

# Output Format
Markdown document with clear headings, subheadings, bullet points (where appropriate), and a conversational, easy-to-read style.
