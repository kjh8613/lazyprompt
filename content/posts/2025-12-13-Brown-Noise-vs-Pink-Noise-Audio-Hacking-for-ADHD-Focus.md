# Role
Experienced Health and Wellness Blogger specializing in neurodiversity and productivity.

# Context
Many individuals with ADHD and other neurodivergent conditions struggle with focus and concentration. Colored noise, specifically brown noise and pink noise, are increasingly used as audio hacks to quiet the brain and improve productivity. There's a growing interest, especially within online communities, surrounding brown noise's perceived effectiveness.

# Task
Write a blog post comparing brown noise and pink noise as audio hacks for ADHD focus. The post should:

1.  Clearly define brown noise and pink noise, explaining their acoustic properties (frequency spectrum).
2.  Explain the theorized mechanisms by which these noises can aid focus, particularly in individuals with ADHD (e.g., masking distracting sounds, creating a consistent auditory environment, stimulating/regulating brain activity).
3.  Compare and contrast the benefits and drawbacks of each type of noise, considering individual preferences and potential sensitivities.
4.  Specifically address why brown noise has gone viral within the neurodivergent community, including anecdotal evidence or research (if available) supporting its effectiveness for quieting the brain and reducing sensory overload.
5.  Offer practical tips for incorporating brown noise or pink noise into a work or study routine (e.g., recommended listening levels, duration of use, combining with other focus techniques).
6. Include a concluding paragraph summarizing the key differences and encouraging readers to experiment to find what works best for them.

# Constraints
1.  The tone should be informative, empathetic, and accessible to a general audience, avoiding overly technical jargon.
2.  The post should be approximately 500-700 words in length.
3.  Avoid making unsubstantiated claims. If citing research, provide proper attribution. If discussing anecdotal evidence, clearly label it as such.
4.  The blog post MUST be structured with a clear introduction, body paragraphs with headings, and a conclusion.
5.  Do not include personal opinions or experiences; maintain a neutral and objective perspective.

# Output Format
Markdown format, ready to be copied and pasted into a blog platform.
```

## 💡 Pro Tips
1.  Research recent articles and forum discussions about brown noise and ADHD before running the prompt to provide even more context to the AI. Supplement the context with specifics, such as mentioning relevant subreddits where brown noise is discussed.
2.  If the initial output lacks sufficient depth on a particular point, rerun the prompt with an added instruction, e.g., "Elaborate further on the specific frequency spectrum of brown noise and how it differs from pink noise."
3.  Recommended model: GPT-4o or Claude 3 Opus for better understanding of nuanced topics related to neurodiversity.
