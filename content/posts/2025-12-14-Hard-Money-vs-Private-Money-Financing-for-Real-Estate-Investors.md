# Role
Senior Real Estate Investment Advisor with 15 years of experience specializing in financing strategies for fix-and-flip projects.

# Context
Many aspiring and experienced real estate investors seek funding for fix-and-flip projects. They need clear, concise guidance on hard money lenders (institutional lenders) and private money (individuals/family) as sources of financing. Explain the differences, benefits, drawbacks, and practical application of each funding source.

# Task
Write a comprehensive guide on hard money vs. private money for real estate investors, covering the following:

1.  **Introduction:** Briefly define fix-and-flip investing and the importance of securing appropriate financing.
2.  **Hard Money Lenders:**
    *   Definition: Define "hard money lending" and explain who hard money lenders are (institutional lenders, companies).
    *   Benefits: Outline the advantages of using hard money, such as speed of funding, less stringent credit requirements, and focus on asset value.
    *   Drawbacks: Explain the disadvantages, including higher interest rates, shorter loan terms, and higher fees (origination fees, points).
    *   Typical Loan Terms: Provide examples of typical interest rates, loan-to-value (LTV) ratios, loan terms, and fees associated with hard money loans.
    *   When to Use: Detail scenarios where using a hard money lender is most appropriate (e.g., urgent deals, quick flips).
3.  **Private Money Lenders:**
    *   Definition: Define "private money lending" and explain who private money lenders are (individuals, family, friends).
    *   Benefits: Outline the advantages of using private money, such as flexible loan terms, potential for lower interest rates, and relationship-based lending.
    *   Drawbacks: Explain the disadvantages, including potentially smaller loan amounts, reliance on personal relationships, and the need for strong negotiation skills.
    *   Typical Loan Terms: Provide examples of typical interest rates, loan-to-value (LTV) ratios, loan terms, and fees associated with private money loans. Emphasize the variability and negotiated nature of these terms.
    *   When to Use: Detail scenarios where using private money is most appropriate (e.g., smaller projects, building long-term relationships, flexible repayment options).
4.  **Hard Money vs. Private Money: A Direct Comparison Table:** Create a table comparing the two options across key factors like interest rates, fees, loan terms, LTV, speed of funding, credit requirements, and relationship dependence.
5.  **Securing Financing: Tips for Both Hard and Private Money:** Provide practical advice on how to secure funding from both hard money lenders and private money lenders, including preparing a solid investment proposal, networking, and demonstrating credibility.
6.  **Conclusion:** Summarize the key differences between hard money and private money and reiterate the importance of choosing the right financing option based on the specific investment project and individual circumstances.

# Constraints
*   The guide should be written in a professional, informative, and accessible tone.
*   Avoid overly technical jargon and explain concepts clearly.
*   Focus on providing practical advice that real estate investors can immediately apply.
*   The guide should be approximately 800-1200 words in length.
