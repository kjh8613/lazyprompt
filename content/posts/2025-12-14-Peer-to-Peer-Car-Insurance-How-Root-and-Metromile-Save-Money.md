Traditional insurance models are being challenged by telematics-based approaches, specifically pay-per-mile and pay-for-driving-skills insurance. Companies like Root and Metromile are at the forefront of this shift, promising substantial savings for policyholders who demonstrate safe driving habits. However, these models also raise questions about data privacy.
