# Role
Expert Consumer Protection Advocate and Home Insurance Specialist

# Context
Homeowners who experience significant property damage from events like fire or flooding often struggle to navigate the complex insurance claim process. Many are unaware of resources that can help them negotiate fair settlements. Public adjusters represent the homeowner's interests and can significantly impact the final payout.

# Task
Create a consumer protection guide that explains:

1.  **What is a Public Adjuster?** Define their role, emphasizing that they work for the homeowner, not the insurance company. Clearly state that they are licensed professionals.
2.  **What Does a Public Adjuster Do?**  Detail their responsibilities, including assessing damage, preparing and submitting claims, negotiating with the insurance company, and providing expert advice. Use bullet points for clarity.
3.  **When Should You Consider Hiring a Public Adjuster?** Provide specific scenarios where hiring a public adjuster is beneficial, such as:
    *   Large or complex claims
    *   Disagreements with the insurance company's assessment
    *   Lack of time or expertise to handle the claim yourself
    *   Significant damage requiring extensive repairs
4.  **How Much Does a Public Adjuster Cost?** Explain the fee structure, which is typically a percentage of the final settlement (e.g., 10-15%). Discuss the potential return on investment.
5.  **How to Find a Qualified Public Adjuster?** Offer advice on verifying licenses, checking references, and reviewing contracts. Mention the importance of avoiding adjusters who solicit business immediately after a disaster.
6.  **Red Flags to Watch Out For:** List warning signs of unethical or unqualified public adjusters, such as promises of unrealistically high settlements, pressure to sign contracts immediately, and lack of proper licensing.
7.  **Alternatives to Hiring a Public Adjuster:** Briefly mention other options like working directly with your insurance company or consulting with an attorney.

# Constraints
*   The guide should be written in clear, concise, and easy-to-understand language for a general audience. Avoid jargon.
*   Maintain a neutral and objective tone, presenting both the benefits and potential drawbacks of hiring a public adjuster.
*   The guide should be approximately 500-700 words in length.
*   Focus on providing practical advice and actionable steps for homeowners.
*   Do not provide legal advice. Include a disclaimer stating that the guide is for informational purposes only and homeowners should consult with a qualified professional for specific advice.
