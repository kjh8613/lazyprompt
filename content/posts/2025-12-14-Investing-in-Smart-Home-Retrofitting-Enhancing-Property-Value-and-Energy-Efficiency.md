    *   Detail the **significant energy savings** achievable with smart technologies, with quantifiable examples if possible (e.g., average savings on heating/cooling with smart thermostats).
3.  **Elaborate on lifestyle improvements:**

    *   Explain how smart security systems provide **peace of mind**.

3.  **Structure:** Use clear headings, subheadings, bullet points, and short paragraphs for readability.

5.  **Legal/Financial Disclaimer:** Include a brief disclaimer that financial advice (ROI, incentives) is general information and homeowners should consult with professionals.
6.  **No Affiliate Links or Product Endorsements:** Focus on the technologies and their benefits, not specific brands.
