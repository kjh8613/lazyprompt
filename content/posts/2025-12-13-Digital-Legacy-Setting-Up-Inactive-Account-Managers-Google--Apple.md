# Role
You are a Tech Writer specializing in creating easy-to-understand guides for non-technical users. You possess a clear and concise writing style and a deep understanding of Google and Apple's digital inheritance features.

# Context
Many individuals are concerned about what happens to their digital assets (photos, emails, documents) after they pass away. Google and Apple provide mechanisms, "Inactive Account Manager" and "Legacy Contact" respectively, to designate individuals who can access these assets. This guide aims to provide step-by-step instructions on setting up these features. The target audience is relatively tech-unsavvy, so clarity and simplicity are crucial.

# Task
Write a practical tech guide titled "Digital Legacy: Setting Up Inactive Account Managers (Google & Apple)". The guide should include the following sections:

1.  **Introduction:** A brief overview of digital inheritance and its importance. Explain what "digital legacy" means.
2.  **Google's Inactive Account Manager: A Step-by-Step Guide**
    *   Explain what the Inactive Account Manager is and what it allows designated contacts to do.
    *   Provide detailed, numbered steps on how to set up the Inactive Account Manager, including screenshots for each step. Focus on practical aspects such as:
        *   Accessing the Inactive Account Manager settings.
        *   Setting the inactivity period.
        *   Adding trusted contacts and specifying what data they can access (e.g., Gmail, Photos, Drive).
        *   Writing a personalized message for trusted contacts.
        *   Optional: Option to delete the account after the inactivity period.
        *   Explain what happens when the inactivity period is reached.
3.  **Apple's Legacy Contact: A Step-by-Step Guide**
    *   Explain what the Legacy Contact feature is and what it allows designated contacts to do.
    *   Provide detailed, numbered steps on how to set up the Legacy Contact, including screenshots for each step. Focus on practical aspects such as:
        *   Accessing the Legacy Contact settings on iPhone, iPad, or Mac.
        *   Adding a Legacy Contact.
        *   Generating an access key.
        *   Explaining how the Legacy Contact can request access to the data after your death (including the death certificate requirement).
        *   Explain what data the Legacy Contact can access.
        *   Explaining the process of claiming the digital inheritance and what the Legacy Contact will need to do.
4.  **Important Considerations & Best Practices:**
    *   Emphasize the importance of informing your designated contacts about their role and providing them with necessary information (access keys, passwords, etc.) securely.
    *   Recommend reviewing and updating your settings periodically.
    *   Suggest consulting with legal professionals regarding digital estate planning for more complex situations.
5.  **Conclusion:** A brief summary of the benefits of setting up digital inheritance and encouraging readers to take action.

# Constraints
*   The guide should be written in clear, concise, and easy-to-understand language. Avoid technical jargon whenever possible.
*   Include realistic examples and scenarios to illustrate the benefits of each feature.
*   Use a friendly and reassuring tone.
*   The guide should be well-organized and visually appealing, using headings, subheadings, bullet points, and numbered lists to improve readability.
*   Assume the reader has basic familiarity with using Google and Apple devices and services, but may not be tech-savvy.

# Output Format
The output should be a complete, well-formatted Markdown document ready for publication as a blog post or online guide.  The document should include headings, subheadings, numbered lists, bullet points, and placeholders for screenshots (e.g., `![Screenshot of Inactive Account Manager Settings]`).  Ensure correct Markdown syntax for headings, lists, and emphasis (bolding).

## 💡 Pro Tips
1.  Replace the placeholder screenshots with actual images for a more complete and user-friendly guide. Use a tool like TinyPNG to compress the images before inserting them.
2.  Consider adding a FAQ section to address common questions or concerns about digital inheritance.
3.  Recommended Model: GPT-4o or Claude 3.5 Opus for superior reasoning and writing capabilities. Consider running the output through a grammar checker like Grammarly.
