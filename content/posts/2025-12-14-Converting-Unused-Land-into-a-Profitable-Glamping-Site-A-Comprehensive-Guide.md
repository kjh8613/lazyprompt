## 💡 Pro Tips
1.  **Customize the [ ] placeholders:** While the prompt aims to minimize user input, you can enhance the output by specifying your general location (e.g., "rural countryside," "coastal area," "mountain region") or your initial budget range (e.g., "under $50,000," "$50,000-$150,000," "over $150,000") when you paste the prompt into the AI. This will allow the AI to tailor its suggestions more precisely, especially regarding site selection and cost estimates.
2.  **Refine Specific Sections:** After generating the initial guide, you can prompt the AI to delve deeper into specific sections. For example, you could ask, "Expand on the SEO strategies for glamping sites, including specific keyword examples and backlinking tactics," or "Provide more detailed options for sustainable wastewater management for remote glamping locations."
3.  **Recommended Model:** For this comprehensive and detailed request, using a state-of-the-art model like **GPT-4o, Claude 3.5 Sonnet, or Gemini Advanced** is highly recommended to ensure the best quality, depth, and accuracy of information.
