# Role
Expert Real Estate Educator specializing in government-backed mortgage programs.

# Context
Many potential homebuyers are unaware of the USDA loan program and its benefits, particularly the 0% down payment option. There's a widespread misunderstanding that USDA loans are solely for agricultural workers or farms. This guide aims to dispel this myth and educate potential buyers about how they can use USDA loans to purchase homes in eligible rural and suburban areas.

# Task
Generate a comprehensive homebuying guide on USDA Rural Development Loans, including the following sections:

1.  **Introduction to USDA Loans:** Briefly explain what USDA loans are and their purpose. Immediately address the common misconception that they're only for farmers, emphasizing that they are available to eligible homebuyers in designated rural and suburban areas.
2.  **Benefits of USDA Loans:** Detail the key benefits, focusing on the 0% down payment, competitive interest rates, and mortgage insurance options.
3.  **Eligibility Requirements:** Clearly outline the income limits, property location requirements (including a link to the USDA eligibility map: [Insert USDA Eligibility Map Link Here]), and credit score requirements. Explain how to determine if a property is in a USDA-eligible area.
4.  **How to Apply for a USDA Loan:** Provide a step-by-step guide on the application process, including finding a USDA-approved lender, gathering necessary documentation (income verification, credit history, etc.), and navigating the underwriting process.
5.  **Debunking the Myths:** Dedicate a section to debunking common myths about USDA loans, such as the belief that they are only for farmers, that they are difficult to qualify for, or that eligible areas are undesirable.
6.  **Tips for a Successful Application:** Offer practical advice on improving your chances of approval, such as improving credit score, reducing debt-to-income ratio, and choosing the right property.
7.  **Conclusion:** Summarize the benefits of USDA loans and encourage readers to explore this option if they meet the eligibility requirements. Include a call to action to contact a USDA-approved lender for more information.

# Constraints
1.  Maintain a positive, informative, and encouraging tone throughout the guide.
2.  Use clear and concise language, avoiding jargon whenever possible. If jargon is necessary, define it clearly.
3.  The guide should be structured logically and easy to navigate.
4.  Do not provide specific financial advice; instead, encourage readers to consult with a qualified financial advisor.
5.  Ensure all information is accurate and up-to-date as of the current date.

# Output Format
Markdown document with clear headings and subheadings for each section, using bullet points and numbered lists where appropriate. Include a placeholder for the USDA Eligibility Map link.

## 💡 Pro Tips
1. Replace "[Insert USDA Eligibility Map Link Here]" with the actual URL of the USDA's property eligibility map. This is crucial for users to quickly check property eligibility.
2. Consider adding a section on the difference between USDA Direct and USDA Guaranteed loans for more in-depth information.
3. Recommended model: GPT-4o, Claude 3.5 Sonnet - these models are good at handling detail and structuring information clearly. You may need to reiterate instructions if the output is too generic.
