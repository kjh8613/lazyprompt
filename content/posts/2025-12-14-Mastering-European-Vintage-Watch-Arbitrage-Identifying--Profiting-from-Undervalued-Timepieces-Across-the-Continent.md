## 💡 Pro Tips
1.  When filling out the `[ ]` placeholders in the prompt, be as specific as possible. For example, for "popular European markets," you could list specific countries you have in mind or want the AI to focus on.
2.  Consider adding a paragraph asking the AI to suggest specific, *fictional* examples of watch brands or models that are often subject to such arbitrage to make the content more concrete and relatable, while still adhering to the "no specific pricing" constraint.
3.  **Recommended Model:** GPT-4o, Claude 3.5 Sonnet, or Gemini 1.5 Pro. These models excel at generating long-form, structured content with nuanced explanations.
