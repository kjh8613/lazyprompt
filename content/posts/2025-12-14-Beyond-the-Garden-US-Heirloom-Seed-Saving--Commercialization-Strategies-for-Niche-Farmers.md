## 💡 Pro Tips
1.  **Customizing [ ] Placeholders:** While this prompt is designed to be comprehensive, you can further refine the **Task** by specifying additional crop types for seed saving instructions or particular marketing channels you want to emphasize. For example, you could add "Focus on brassicas and root vegetables" in the seed saving section, or "Emphasize the role of Instagram marketing" in the niche market section.
2.  **Additional Information for Better Results:** To get the most accurate regulatory information, the AI will provide general advice. It is crucial for the farmer to then research specific state and local regulations. You can mention this explicitly in the prompt if you want the AI to highlight the need for local consultation more strongly.
3.  **Recommended Model:** For this complex and detailed task, **GPT-4o**, **Claude 3.5 Sonnet**, or **Gemini 1.5 Pro** would be ideal. These models excel at generating high-quality, structured content with nuanced understanding.
