## 🎯 Prompt Description

This prompt generates a beginner-friendly Python automation tutorial blog post, complete with code examples. It simplifies Python automation concepts, enabling beginners to easily automate daily tasks.

## 📋 Copy This Prompt
```markdown
# Role
Seasoned Technical Blogger & Python Automation Expert

# Context
Many individuals are looking to automate repetitive daily tasks to save time and improve efficiency. Python, with its simple syntax and extensive libraries, is an excellent tool for achieving this. The target audience is beginners with little to no prior programming experience.

# Task
1.  Write a blog post titled "Python Automation for Beginners: Automate Your Daily Tasks".
2.  Begin with a brief introduction explaining what Python automation is and why it's useful.
3.  Provide a step-by-step guide on setting up Python (including installing Python and necessary libraries like `schedule`, `requests`, and `os`).
4.  Present **three** practical and easy-to-understand Python code examples with detailed explanations for each:
    *   **Example 1: Automatically Backing Up Files:** Show how to create a script that automatically backs up specific files to a designated folder using the `shutil` module and `datetime` for timestamping.
    *   **Example 2: Sending Automated Emails:** Demonstrate how to send automated emails using the `smtplib` and `email` modules. Include a section on setting up app passwords for Gmail or other email providers.
    *   **Example 3: Running Tasks on a Schedule:** Explain how to use the `schedule` library to schedule tasks (e.g., running the backup script or sending an email) at specific times. Include how to handle potential errors and log activities.
5.  Include clear and concise comments within each code example to explain each step.
6.  Conclude the blog post with tips for further learning and exploration of Python automation. Encourage readers to experiment and adapt the examples to their own needs.

# Constraints
1.  **Target Audience:** Beginners with little to no Python experience. Keep the language simple, clear, and avoid technical jargon whenever possible.
2.  **Tone:** Friendly, encouraging, and approachable. Focus on making the topic accessible and non-intimidating.
3.  **Code Formatting:** Use Markdown code blocks with appropriate syntax highlighting for Python. Ensure code is clean, well-formatted, and easy to read.
4.  **Conciseness:** Keep the blog post length reasonable (around 800-1200 words). Focus on delivering essential information efficiently.
5.  **Originality:** Do not copy content directly from existing tutorials. Provide unique examples and explanations.

# Output Format
Blog post in Markdown format, including a title, introduction, setup guide, three code examples with explanations, and a conclusion. Each code example should be within a separate Markdown code block.

```
## 💡 Pro Tips
1.  Customize the code examples by providing more specific file paths, email addresses, or schedules that resonate with your own daily tasks.
2.  Provide information on debugging, error handling (e.g., using `try...except` blocks) and logging (using the `logging` module) to make the tutorial more robust.
3.  Recommended model: GPT-4o is great for providing complex code examples and writing in an easy-to-understand manner.
