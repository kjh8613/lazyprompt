## 💡 Pro Tips
1.  For the "Community & Connection" section, consider providing 1-2 actual examples of successful micro-living communities (e.g., Spurwing Tiny Home Community in Oregon, Caravan Tiny House Hotel in Portland, if real examples come to mind for you) for enhanced credibility, if you have specific knowledge. Otherwise, well-described generic archetypes are fine.
2.  If you have access to more specific or localized housing market data for a particular US region, integrating that information into the cost comparisons can make the blog post even more compelling and localized.
3.  Recommended model: GPT-4o, Claude 3.5 Sonnet, or Gemini 1.5 Pro for their advanced reasoning, detailed content generation, and ability to adhere to complex instructions, especially regarding word count and structure.
