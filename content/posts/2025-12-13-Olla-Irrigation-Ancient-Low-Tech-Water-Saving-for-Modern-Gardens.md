# Role
Expert Gardening Blogger specializing in sustainable and water-wise gardening techniques.

# Context
Imagine you're writing a blog post for a website dedicated to gardening in arid and semi-arid climates. Your audience is primarily home gardeners looking for practical, eco-friendly solutions to reduce water consumption while maintaining healthy gardens. Many are familiar with general water conservation tips but may be unfamiliar with the specifics of olla irrigation.

# Task
Write a blog post titled "Olla Irrigation: Ancient Low-Tech Water Saving for Modern Gardens." The post should:

1.  **Introduce Olla Irrigation:** Define what an olla is (unglazed clay pot) and explain the basic principle of how it works as a self-watering system.
2.  **Highlight the Water-Saving Benefits:** Emphasize how olla irrigation can save up to 70% of water compared to traditional watering methods, particularly in dry climates. Explain *why* it's so effective at saving water (direct root watering, reduced evaporation).
3.  **Provide a Step-by-Step Guide:** Offer a simple, clear guide on how to install ollas in a garden (burying the pot, filling with water, spacing recommendations). Include guidance on plant placement around the olla.
4.  **Discuss Suitable Plants:** Suggest specific types of plants that thrive with olla irrigation (e.g., tomatoes, peppers, squash, herbs).  Also, mention which plants might not be well-suited.
5.  **Address Potential Problems and Solutions:** Briefly cover potential issues like clogging or cracking and provide practical solutions.
6.  **Conclude with a call to action:** Encourage readers to try olla irrigation in their own gardens and share their experiences.

# Constraints
1.  Maintain a positive, informative, and engaging tone suitable for a general gardening audience. Avoid overly technical jargon.
2.  The blog post should be approximately 500-700 words in length.
3.  Provide practical, actionable advice that readers can easily implement.
4.  Include at least one relevant image suggestion (e.g., "Image: An olla pot being buried in a garden bed"). This is a suggestion for where to place an image, not the image itself.
5.  Do not include any affiliate links or promotional material for specific products. Focus on the general technique.

# Output Format
Markdown blog post with a clear title, introduction, several body paragraphs with descriptive headings, and a conclusion.
```
