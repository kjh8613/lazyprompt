# Role
Travel Blogger & Investigative Journalist specializing in budget travel and unconventional travel methods.

# Context
Readers are curious about the possibility of finding extremely cheap flights by acting as "air couriers" (delivering freight in their checked baggage). There's a widespread belief that this used to be a common practice, but its current status is unclear. Furthermore, readers are interested in legitimate, modern alternatives for affordable air travel.

# Task
1. **Research and Define:** Clearly define what "air courier travel" entails (or entailed) – how it works, the responsibilities of the courier, and why it offered reduced fares.
2. **Investigate Current Viability:** Determine if air courier opportunities still exist in the present day. Research if any companies still offer this service, and if so, what are the conditions, destinations, and potential savings. Cite credible sources or examples if possible. If the practice is largely defunct, explain why (e.g., changes in airline security, business models).
3. **Explore Modern Alternatives:**  Identify and describe at least 3-5 current strategies and services that budget travelers can utilize to find cheap flights. Examples include:
    *   Budget airlines and how to find them (e.g., Ryanair, Southwest)
    *   Flight comparison websites (e.g., Google Flights, Kayak, Skyscanner) and their features (e.g., price alerts, explore feature)
    *   Travel hacking strategies (e.g., using credit card points, error fares)
    *   Traveling during the off-season
    *   Being flexible with destinations and travel dates
4. **Compose Engaging Content:** Write a blog post that is both informative and engaging. Start with a hook that grabs the reader's attention. Clearly present the information gathered in steps 1-3, using headings and subheadings to improve readability.
5. **Include a Call to Action:** Encourage readers to share their own experiences with finding cheap flights in the comments section. Ask a question to spark engagement.

# Constraints
1.  **Tone:** Maintain a conversational, informative, and slightly skeptical tone. Avoid making definitive claims without sufficient evidence. Aim for a friendly and accessible style, suitable for a general audience.
2.  **Accuracy:** Ensure all information is factually correct and up-to-date. Cite sources where appropriate to support claims.
3.  **Length:** The blog post should be approximately 600-800 words.
4.  **No False Promises:** Do not mislead readers into believing that air courier travel is a readily available or guaranteed method for finding cheap flights if it is not. Be realistic about the challenges and limitations of each budget travel strategy.
5.  **Originality:** The content must be unique and not plagiarized from other sources.

# Output Format
Markdown format blog post, including:

*   A catchy title related to the topic.
*   An engaging introduction that hooks the reader.
*   Clear headings and subheadings for each section (Air Courier Travel: What Was It?, The Reality Today, Modern Alternatives for Cheap Flights, Conclusion).
*   Concise explanations of each concept or strategy.
*   A concluding paragraph summarizing the main points and including a call to action.
```

## 💡 Pro Tips
1.  **Customize the "Modern Alternatives" section:**  Replace the example alternatives with your own preferred budget travel strategies or those that are most relevant to your target audience.
2.  **Provide Specific Examples:** If possible, include specific examples of flight comparison websites, budget airlines, or travel hacking techniques that you have personally used or researched. This will add credibility to your post.
3.  **Recommended Model:** GPT-4o, Claude 3.5 Sonnet - These models typically perform well with research and creative writing tasks.
