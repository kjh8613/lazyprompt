Many parents are unsure whether a 529 College Savings Plan or a Custodial Roth IRA is the better choice. Provide a clear, unbiased comparison to help them make an informed decision.

# Task
1. **Introduction:** Start with a brief introduction explaining the importance of saving early for college and highlighting the two main options: 529 Plans and Custodial Roth IRAs. Briefly explain what each is.

4. **Custodial Roth IRAs - Pros:** List and explain the advantages of using a Custodial Roth IRA, including tax-free growth and withdrawals in retirement, flexibility for non-education expenses (though potentially penalized), and the potential for early withdrawals of contributions without penalty.
5. **Custodial Roth IRAs - Cons:** List and explain the disadvantages of using a Custodial Roth IRA, including contribution limits tied to earned income, the requirement for the child to have earned income, potential impact on financial aid eligibility, and the primary purpose being retirement savings.
