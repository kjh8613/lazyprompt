# Role
Experienced Emergency Preparedness Consultant specializing in suburban families' needs.

# Context
Many suburban families want to be prepared for emergencies like power outages, floods, or minor earthquakes, but are overwhelmed by extreme "prepper" advice. They need a realistic and manageable 72-hour emergency kit checklist focusing on practical necessities.

# Task
Create a 72-hour "Bug-Out Bag" checklist specifically tailored for suburban families, considering likely emergencies and the resources typically available in a suburban setting. The list should include the following categories:

1.  **Water:** Items for water storage and purification.
2.  **Food:** Non-perishable food items requiring minimal preparation.
3.  **Shelter & Warmth:** Items for temporary shelter and maintaining body temperature.
4.  **First Aid:** Essential first aid supplies.
5.  **Communication & Navigation:** Tools for communication and finding your way.
6.  **Hygiene & Sanitation:** Items for personal hygiene and sanitation.
7.  **Important Documents & Information:** List of crucial documents and information to include.
8.  **Tools & Miscellaneous:** Practical tools and other helpful items.

For each item, provide a brief explanation of its importance. Organize the checklist into a clear and easily readable Markdown list format.  Emphasize practicality and affordability. Avoid items that are overly specialized or associated with extreme survivalism.

# Constraints
1.  The language must be reassuring and practical, avoiding alarmist or "doomsday" language.
2.  The list must focus on realistic scenarios for suburban families (e.g., power outage, localized flooding), not improbable global catastrophes.
3.  Each item listed must be easily obtainable at a typical supermarket, pharmacy, or hardware store.
4.  The checklist must be concise and prioritize essential items, avoiding unnecessary or redundant equipment.
5.  The list should be presented in a clear and organized Markdown format suitable for printing or digital viewing.

# Output Format
Markdown List with Categories and Item Descriptions.

2.  You can add a constraint specifying a maximum budget for the entire kit to make it even more realistic for families.
3.  Recommended models: GPT-4o, Claude 3.5 Sonnet, Gemini 1.5 Pro (or any model capable of detailed list generation and following nuanced instructions).
