# Context
The US real estate market, particularly in major urban and suburban areas, faces persistent affordability challenges. Simultaneously, there's a rising interest in minimalist living, sustainability, and accessible homeownership. "Tiny home flipping," the process of acquiring, renovating, and reselling small, efficient homes, presents a unique financial opportunity in these high-cost markets. Investors can leverage lower acquisition costs and streamlined renovation processes to achieve substantial profit margins by meeting the demand for affordable and eco-conscious housing.

1.  **Financial Opportunities & Profit Margins:**
    *   Explain how acquiring and renovating tiny homes can be more profitable than traditional real estate flips in expensive markets.
    *   Discuss the factors contributing to high profit margins (lower initial investment, faster turnaround, specific buyer demand).
    *   Provide hypothetical examples or scenarios to illustrate potential ROI.

2.  **Acquisition Strategies:**
    *   Where and how to find suitable tiny home properties (e.g., distressed single-family lots, ADU potential, vacant land).
    *   Due diligence considerations for tiny home acquisitions.

    *   Smart, budget-friendly renovation ideas tailored for small spaces.

4.  **Legal & Zoning Considerations:**
    *   Explain the importance of understanding local zoning laws, building codes, and permit requirements for tiny homes.
    *   Highlight common challenges and how to navigate them (e.g., minimum square footage, foundation requirements, utility hookups).
    *   Advise on seeking professional legal and architectural guidance.

5.  **Marketing & Buyer Attraction:**
    *   Strategies for marketing tiny homes to specific buyer demographics (e.g., first-time homebuyers, minimalists, eco-conscious individuals, urban professionals seeking an escape).
    *   Highlighting the tangible economic advantage (affordability) and lifestyle shift (simplicity, sustainability).
    *   Effective listing descriptions and visual presentation.

6.  **Tangible Economic Advantage & Lifestyle Shift:**
    *   Elaborate on how tiny home flipping benefits both investors (equity creation, passive income potential) and end-buyers (affordability, reduced living expenses, sustainable living).

1.  **Customization:** Replace `[ ]` placeholders in the prompt if you have specific data points or geographic regions in mind, such as mentioning particular US cities known for high costs and demand (e.g., "San Francisco Bay Area," "Los Angeles," "Seattle").
2.  **Target Audience Refinement:** If you're targeting a specific type of investor (e.g., those with limited capital, experienced flippers), you can adjust the "Context" and "Task" to tailor the advice more precisely. For instance, you could ask the AI to include a section on "Financing Tiny Home Flips."
