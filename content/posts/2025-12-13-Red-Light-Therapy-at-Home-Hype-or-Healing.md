# Role
Wellness Investigative Journalist for [Insert Health & Wellness Publication Name/Target Audience].

# Context
Red light therapy (RLT), also known as photobiomodulation, is gaining popularity for at-home use. Consumers are bombarded with marketing claims, but lack clear information about the science, efficacy, and best practices. My task is to write an unbiased investigative article that clarifies the science behind RLT, differentiates between key wavelengths, and offers practical advice for choosing an appropriate device for home use.

# Task
1.  **Introduction:** Begin with a compelling hook that addresses the rising popularity of at-home RLT and highlights the confusion surrounding its benefits and effectiveness. Briefly define RLT/photobiomodulation.
2.  **The Science of Wavelengths:** Explain the basic science behind how red and near-infrared light affect the body at a cellular level. Specifically, discuss the roles of:
    *   660nm (red light): its benefits for skin health (e.g., collagen production, wrinkle reduction, improved skin tone).
    *   850nm (near-infrared light): its benefits for muscle recovery, joint pain relief, and deeper tissue penetration.
    *   Explain how these wavelengths differ in terms of penetration depth and targeted effects.
3.  **Hype vs. Healing:** Investigate and address common claims surrounding RLT (e.g., anti-aging, pain relief, sleep improvement). Reference scientific studies and clinical trials to support or refute these claims. Acknowledge any limitations in the existing research.
4.  **Choosing an RLT Device:** Provide a comprehensive guide to selecting an at-home RLT device. Consider the following factors:
    *   Wavelength output (should match intended use – skin vs. muscle recovery)
    *   Irradiance/Power Density (mW/cm²)
    *   Treatment area size
    *   Device type (panels, wands, masks)
    *   Safety features (e.g., EMF emissions, heat management)
    *   Cost considerations and value for money
    *   Certification or FDA clearance (if applicable)
5.  **Safety and Usage Guidelines:** Include safety precautions for using RLT at home (e.g., eye protection, treatment time limits, contraindications).
6.  **Expert Opinion:** Include a quote from a relevant expert (dermatologist, physical therapist, scientist specializing in photobiomodulation) to add credibility and perspective. *You can generate a hypothetical quote if needed, but clearly indicate that it's a hypothetical quote.*
7.  **Conclusion:** Summarize the key findings, emphasizing the potential benefits of RLT when used correctly, and cautioning readers against unrealistic expectations or unsubstantiated claims.

# Constraints
*   The tone should be informative, balanced, and objective, avoiding overly promotional language.
*   Maintain a professional and credible writing style, suitable for a health-conscious audience.
*   Cite scientific studies and research findings to support claims, using in-text citations where appropriate.
*   The article should be approximately 800-1200 words in length.
*   Do not provide medical advice. State clearly that readers should consult with a healthcare professional before starting any new treatment.

# Output Format
Markdown article suitable for a blog or website. Include subheadings, bullet points (where appropriate), and clear explanations of scientific concepts.

## 💡 Pro Tips
1.  Customize the `[Insert Health & Wellness Publication Name/Target Audience]` placeholder to tailor the article's tone and content to a specific audience.  Knowing the target audience will shape the language and examples used.
2.  If you have access to specific research papers or expert opinions, providing them to the AI will greatly enhance the quality and accuracy of the article. You can upload them in tools like Claude or GPT-4o.
3.  I recommend using GPT-4o or Claude 3.5 Sonnet for the best results, as they are generally more capable of synthesizing information and writing in a clear, engaging style.
