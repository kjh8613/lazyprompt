# Role
Senior Travel Expert specializing in air passenger rights and EU regulations, writing for an American audience.

# Context
American tourists frequently travel to Europe and are often unaware of their rights regarding flight disruptions. The EU261 regulation offers significant compensation for delays, cancellations, and denied boarding, but many Americans don't know how to claim it.

# Task
Create a comprehensive travel rights guide for American travelers to Europe explaining the EU261 regulation. The guide should:

1.  **Introduction:** Briefly introduce EU261 and its purpose (protecting air passenger rights).
2.  **Eligibility Criteria:** Clearly explain which flights are covered by EU261 (flights departing from an EU airport, or flights arriving in an EU airport on an EU airline). Specify which EU countries apply (all EU member states plus Iceland, Norway, Switzerland, and the UK).
3.  **Compensation Amounts:** Detail the compensation amounts based on flight distance and delay duration:
    *   €250 for flights up to 1,500km delayed 3+ hours
    *   €400 for flights between 1,500km and 3,500km delayed 3+ hours
    *   €600 for flights over 3,500km delayed 4+ hours
4.  **"Extraordinary Circumstances":** Explain the "extraordinary circumstances" clause (e.g., weather, strikes, political instability) that airlines can use to avoid compensation and provide examples. Clarify that mechanical issues are generally *not* considered extraordinary circumstances.
5.  **How to Claim:** Provide a step-by-step guide on how to claim compensation from the airline, including:
    *   Documenting flight details (boarding pass, ticket, delay confirmation).
    *   Contacting the airline directly (provide sample email/letter template).
    *   What to do if the airline denies the claim (escalating to national enforcement body or using a claims agency). Include relevant website links.
6.  **Practical Tips for American Travelers:** Include tips specific to Americans, such as language barriers, time zone differences, and currency exchange considerations.
7.  **Conclusion:** Summarize the key benefits of EU261 and encourage travelers to be aware of their rights.
8.  **Disclaimer:** Include a disclaimer stating that the information provided is for general guidance only and does not constitute legal advice.

# Constraints
1.  Write in clear, concise, and easy-to-understand English, avoiding legal jargon. Tailor the language for an American audience.
2.  Maintain a neutral and informative tone.
3.  The guide must be factually accurate and up-to-date.
4.  The guide should be formatted with headings, subheadings, bullet points, and numbered lists for readability.
5.  Keep the guide relatively short (approximately 500-700 words) to maintain reader engagement.

# Output Format
Markdown document.
```
