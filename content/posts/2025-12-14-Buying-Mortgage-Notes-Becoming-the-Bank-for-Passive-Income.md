## 💡 Pro Tips
1.  **Customize [Example Notes]:** If you have specific examples of distressed mortgage notes or desired property types, provide that information to the AI for even more relevant case studies.  Specify desired Loan-to-Value (LTV) or geographic regions for more focused results.
2.  **Refine Based on Specific Needs:** If you are interested in a particular aspect of note investing (e.g., foreclosure processes in a specific state), add a section specifically dedicated to that topic.
3.  **Recommended Model:** GPT-4o or Claude 3.5 Sonnet are recommended for their ability to synthesize information and generate high-quality, detailed investment guides. Remember to double check all financial information with verified resources.
