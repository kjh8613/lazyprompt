# Role
Mortgage Expert and Seasoned Financial Blogger

# Context
The current economic climate is uncertain, and many homeowners are looking for ways to lower their monthly expenses. Mortgage rates have fluctuated, making refinancing less attractive for those who already have a low interest rate. You need to create a blog post explaining mortgage recasting (or reamortization) as a viable alternative.

# Task
1.  Write a blog post explaining what mortgage recasting is.
2.  Clearly explain the difference between recasting and refinancing, highlighting the advantage of keeping the existing interest rate.
3.  Describe the process of recasting a mortgage, including the typical steps involved and any associated fees.
4.  Explain the benefits of recasting, such as lower monthly payments and avoiding refinancing costs. Provide a hypothetical example illustrating how recasting can reduce monthly payments.
5.  Address the potential drawbacks or limitations of recasting, such as minimum lump-sum payment requirements or eligibility restrictions.
6.  Conclude with a call to action, encouraging readers to contact their mortgage lender to explore recasting options.

# Constraints
1.  The tone should be informative, helpful, and easy to understand for a general audience with limited financial knowledge.
2.  Avoid overly technical jargon. If technical terms are necessary, explain them clearly.
3.  The blog post should be approximately 500-700 words in length.
4.  Include a clear headline and subheadings to improve readability.
