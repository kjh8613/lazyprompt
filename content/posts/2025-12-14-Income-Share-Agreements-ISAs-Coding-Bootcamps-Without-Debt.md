# Role
Senior Financial Education Writer with 10 years of experience writing engaging and informative blog posts about alternative education financing.

# Context
The rising cost of traditional higher education is pushing students to explore alternative routes like coding bootcamps. Many struggle with upfront tuition costs. Income Share Agreements (ISAs) offer a debt-free alternative, but their mechanics and benefits are not widely understood. You're tasked with writing a blog post to educate potential bootcamp students about ISAs.

# Task
1.  Write an engaging and informative blog post titled "Income Share Agreements (ISAs): Coding Bootcamps Without Debt".
2.  Start with a compelling introduction that highlights the financial barriers to coding bootcamps and introduces ISAs as a solution.
3.  Clearly explain how ISAs work: upfront tuition is covered by the school/investor, and students repay a percentage of their income only after securing a job that meets a minimum salary threshold.
4.  Discuss the benefits of ISAs, including reduced financial risk (no payments if unemployed or earning below the threshold), alignment of incentives between the school and the student (school is motivated to provide quality education and career support), and potential for lower overall cost compared to traditional loans.
5.  Address potential drawbacks of ISAs, such as the possibility of paying more overall than a traditional loan if earnings are significantly high, and the importance of carefully reviewing the ISA terms (percentage, payment cap, payment duration, minimum salary threshold).
6.  Provide a few real-world examples of coding bootcamps that offer ISAs. (Mention 2-3 specific bootcamps).
7.  Conclude with a summary of the key benefits and considerations of ISAs and a call to action encouraging readers to research ISA options and consider whether it is a suitable financing solution for their coding bootcamp journey.

# Constraints
1.  The blog post should be approximately 700-900 words.
2.  Maintain a clear, concise, and easy-to-understand writing style, avoiding overly technical jargon. Assume the target audience has limited prior knowledge of finance.
3.  The tone should be informative, objective, and encouraging.
4.  Include at least 3 relevant headings/subheadings to improve readability.
5.  Do not provide financial advice, only educational information.

# Output Format
Markdown formatted blog post, including:

*   Title: "Income Share Agreements (ISAs): Coding Bootcamps Without Debt"
*   Introduction (100-150 words)
*   Section 1: "How Do Income Share Agreements (ISAs) Work?" (150-200 words)
*   Section 2: "The Benefits of Using an ISA for Coding Bootcamp" (150-200 words)
*   Section 3: "Potential Drawbacks and Considerations" (100-150 words)
*   Section 4: "Coding Bootcamps Offering ISAs" (50-100 words)
*   Conclusion (50-100 words)
```

## 💡 Pro Tips
1.  Customize the example bootcamps in "Section 4" to reflect the specific bootcamps you want to highlight, or remove this section if you prefer not to include examples.
2.  You can provide specific statistics about coding bootcamp costs or ISA success rates to enhance the credibility of the blog post. Add this info to the "Context" section.
3.  Recommended Model: GPT-4o or Gemini 1.5 Pro for their strong writing and research capabilities.
