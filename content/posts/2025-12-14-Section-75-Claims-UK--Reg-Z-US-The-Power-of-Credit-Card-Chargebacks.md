# Role
Expert Consumer Rights Advocate & Financial Educator

# Context
Consumers are often unaware of their legal rights regarding credit card chargebacks when a merchant fails to deliver goods or services, or goes bankrupt. Many believe debit cards offer similar protection, which is incorrect. A clear, informative guide is needed to educate consumers on how to leverage credit card chargebacks for superior protection.

# Task
Write a consumer protection guide with the following sections:

1.  **Title:** "Credit Card Chargebacks: Your Shield Against Merchant Failure (UK & US)"
2.  **Introduction:** Briefly explain the concept of a chargeback and its purpose in protecting consumers.
3.  **Section 75 (UK): The Law is On Your Side:**
    *   Explain Section 75 of the Consumer Credit Act 1974, clearly stating that it makes the credit card company jointly liable with the merchant for purchases between £100 and £30,000.
    *   Provide specific examples of situations where Section 75 applies (e.g., undelivered goods, faulty services, merchant bankruptcy).
    *   Explain the process for making a Section 75 claim, including required documentation and deadlines.
4.  **Regulation Z (US): Chargeback Rights:**
    *   Explain Regulation Z of the Truth in Lending Act and its provisions for chargebacks in the US.
    *   Detail the circumstances under which a US consumer can dispute a credit card charge (e.g., unauthorized charges, undelivered goods, services not rendered, misrepresentation of quality).
    *   Outline the steps for filing a chargeback claim with the credit card issuer, including the timeframe and required information.
5.  **Credit Cards vs. Debit Cards: A Crucial Difference:**
    *   Clearly explain why credit cards offer superior protection compared to debit cards in cases of merchant failure or bankruptcy. Highlight the legal backing of Section 75 and Regulation Z.
    *   Explain the limitations of debit card chargebacks, emphasizing they are often at the discretion of the bank and lack the same legal basis.
    *   Provide a table summarizing the key differences in protection between credit and debit cards.
6.  **Practical Tips for a Successful Chargeback:**
    *   Offer actionable advice on gathering evidence (e.g., order confirmations, communication with the merchant, photos, etc.).
    *   Explain how to properly document and submit a chargeback claim.
    *   Advise on what to do if the initial claim is rejected.
7.  **Conclusion:** Reiterate the importance of understanding chargeback rights and using credit cards strategically for consumer protection.
8.  **Disclaimer:** Include a standard disclaimer stating that this guide is for informational purposes only and does not constitute legal advice. Consumers should consult with a legal professional for specific guidance.
