## 💡 Pro Tips
1.  When using the prompt, you can customize the `[ ]` placeholders by being more specific about the desired tone (e.g., "more academic," "more folksy") or by adding specific details about your personal orchard if you want the AI to reference it metaphorically.
2.  For even better results, you can add a sentence to the **Context** section like: "The author's own journey into preserving their family's historic orchard will be subtly woven into the narrative as an inspirational element." This encourages a more personal touch.
3.  **Recommended Model:** GPT-4o, Claude 3.5 Sonnet, or Gemini 1.5 Pro. These models excel at generating creative, well-structured, and contextually relevant content.
