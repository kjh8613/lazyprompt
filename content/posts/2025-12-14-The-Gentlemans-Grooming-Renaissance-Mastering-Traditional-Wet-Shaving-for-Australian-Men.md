    *   **Tangible Skin Comfort:** Emphasize the reduction in irritation, razor burn, and ingrown hairs, leading to demonstrably healthier and smoother skin.

3.  **The "How": A Step-by-Step Wet Shaving Guide:**
    *   **Equipment Essentials:**
        *   **Razors:** Briefly explain safety razors (double-edge) and perhaps mention straight razors as an advanced option.
        *   **Brushes:** Discuss badger vs. synthetic bristles and their benefits.
        *   **Soaps/Creams:** Highlight the quality and lathering capabilities of traditional shaving soaps and creams.

            *   Explain the importance of a light touch.
            *   Detail the correct blade angle (approximately 30 degrees).

5.  **Conclusion:**
    *   Reiterate the core benefits.
    *   Encourage readers to embark on their wet shaving journey.
    *   Include a call to action (e.g., "Share your experiences," "Start your journey today").

# Constraints
1.  **Tone:** Maintain an engaging, informative, and sophisticated tone, appealing to Australian men who value quality and tradition. Avoid overly technical jargon unless explained.
2.  **Keyword Integration:** Naturally incorporate keywords such as 'traditional wet shaving Australia', 'safety razor tips', 'men's grooming Australia', and 'best shaving soap' throughout the text.
3.  **Structure:** Use clear headings, subheadings, and bullet points for readability.
4.  **Length:** Aim for a comprehensive blog post that is between 800-1200 words.
5.  **No Product Endorsements:** Do not specifically endorse any single brand unless it's a general category (e.g., "high-quality shaving soap"). Focus on the *types* of products and their benefits.

# Output Format
Markdown format suitable for a blog post, including headings, subheadings, paragraphs, and bullet points.

## 💡 Pro Tips
1.  **Customize Placeholders:** The prompt is designed to be comprehensive. If you have specific Australian brands in mind that you'd like to subtly hint at or focus on, you can edit the "Australian Specifics" section to mention them.
2.  **Advanced Techniques:** For a more advanced version, you could ask the AI to include a small section on "Advanced Techniques" covering cross-grain and against-the-grain shaving, or different razor types (e.g., open comb vs. closed comb safety razors), but keep it brief to avoid overwhelming beginners.
3.  **Recommended Model:** This prompt is best handled by advanced models like **GPT-4o**, **Claude 3.5 Sonnet**, or **Gemini 1.5 Pro** to ensure nuanced tone, comprehensive content, and natural keyword integration.
