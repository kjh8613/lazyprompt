# Role
Act as a leading expert in disaster recovery housing finance and a skilled technical writer specializing in government assistance programs.

# Context
A natural disaster, such as a hurricane, wildfire, or earthquake, has recently occurred and has been designated a Presidentially Declared Disaster area by the U.S. Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA). Many homeowners in this area have had their primary residences completely destroyed or substantially damaged. These individuals are facing immense financial strain and need clear, actionable information on how they can finance the reconstruction or purchase of a new home without the immediate burden of a down payment. The FHA 203(h) program is specifically designed for this scenario.

# Task
Create a niche disaster relief guide in English titled "Rebuilding Your Home After Disaster: Understanding the FHA 203(h) Loan for 100% Financing."

Your guide should:
1.  **Introduce the FHA 203(h) loan program:** Clearly explain its purpose and who it is designed for.
2.  **Detail the eligibility requirements:** Specify who can qualify for this loan, focusing on the "destroyed or substantially damaged" home criteria in a Presidentially Declared Disaster area.
3.  **Explain the "100% financing" benefit:** Emphasize that this means no down payment is required.
4.  **Outline what the loan can be used for:** Specify that it covers the purchase of a new home or the reconstruction of the damaged one.
5.  **Mention key program features:** Include details on loan limits (and where to find them), interest rates (general nature), and the fact that it's an FHA-insured mortgage.
6.  **Describe the application process (high-level):** Briefly explain the steps a potential borrower would take, such as finding an FHA-approved lender and submitting an application.
7.  **Include important considerations and next steps:** Advise on gathering necessary documentation (like disaster declarations), consulting with lenders, and understanding insurance settlements.
8.  **Provide a concluding encouraging statement:** Offer hope and support to disaster victims.

# Constraints
1.  **Tone:** Empathetic, informative, clear, and encouraging. Avoid overly technical jargon where possible, or explain it simply.
2.  **Accuracy:** All information must be factually correct regarding the FHA 203(h) program as it stands.
3.  **Structure:** Use clear headings and subheadings for readability.
4.  **Prohibition:** Do not provide specific financial advice or guarantee loan approval. State that eligibility and terms are determined by lenders and FHA guidelines.
5.  **Length:** Aim for a guide that is comprehensive yet concise enough for a disaster victim to easily digest. Approximately 800-1200 words.

# Output Format
Markdown format, including the main title, section headings, bullet points for lists, and bold text for emphasis.
```

## 💡 Pro Tips
1.  **Customizing Placeholders:** The prompt is designed to be a "copy-paste" solution and does not include [ ] placeholders for user input. If you wish to tailor it for a *specific* disaster event (e.g., Hurricane Ian relief), you could add a sentence to the #Context like: "This guide is specifically tailored to assist residents affected by [Specific Disaster Name] in [Specific State/Region]."
2.  **Additional Information:** For even greater detail on loan limits, you could add a note within the #Task to "include a placeholder for users to check the FHA loan limits for their specific area, as these vary by county and are subject to change." This would prompt the AI to add guidance on where to find that information (e.g., HUD website).
3.  **Recommended Model:** GPT-4o, Claude 3.5 Sonnet, or Gemini Advanced. These models excel at understanding nuanced instructions, maintaining a specific tone, and generating well-structured, informative content.
