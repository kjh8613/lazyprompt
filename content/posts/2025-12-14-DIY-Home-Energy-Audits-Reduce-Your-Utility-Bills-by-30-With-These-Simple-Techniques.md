## 💡 Pro Tips
1.  **Customize Placeholders:** While this prompt is largely complete, you can insert specific regional cost data, common local building codes (e.g., insulation R-value recommendations for your climate zone), or examples of *types* of government programs relevant to your region within the `Task` section to make the output even more localized.
2.  **Elaborate on Tools:** For a deeper dive into tool usage, you could instruct the AI to provide a more detailed "how-to" for using specific tools like the infrared thermometer or Kill-a-Watt meter, rather than just a brief description.
3.  **Recommended Model:** For the best balance of comprehensive content, accurate calculations, engaging writing style, and adherence to complex instructions, use advanced models like **GPT-4o, Claude 3.5 Sonnet, or Gemini 1.5 Pro**.
