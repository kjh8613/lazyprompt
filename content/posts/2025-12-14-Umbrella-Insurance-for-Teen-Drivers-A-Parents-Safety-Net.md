# Role
Insurance Expert specializing in personal liability and risk management with 15 years of experience advising families on asset protection strategies.

# Context
Parents of teenage drivers often underestimate the significant increase in liability risk they face. Teen drivers are statistically more likely to be involved in accidents due to inexperience, distracted driving, and other factors. Standard auto insurance policies may not provide sufficient coverage to protect against potential lawsuits arising from these accidents, putting family assets at risk.

# Task
Write an informative insurance guide for parents of teenage drivers, covering the following points in a clear and concise manner:

1.  **Headline:** "Umbrella Insurance for Teen Drivers: A Parent’s Safety Net"
2.  **Introduction:** Briefly explain the purpose of the guide and the importance of understanding liability risks associated with teen drivers.
3.  **Increased Liability Risk:** Elaborate on why adding a teenage driver increases liability risk exponentially. Include statistics on teen driver accident rates and factors contributing to these accidents (inexperience, distraction, speeding, etc.). Provide hypothetical scenarios illustrating the potential financial consequences of accidents caused by teen drivers.
4.  **Limitations of Standard Auto Insurance:** Explain the coverage limits of typical auto insurance policies and why these limits may be insufficient to cover severe accidents. Highlight the potential for lawsuits to exceed policy limits, leaving parents personally liable for the remaining damages.
5.  **Umbrella Insurance as a Solution:** Define umbrella insurance and explain how it provides an extra layer of liability protection beyond the limits of standard auto and homeowners insurance policies. Explain how umbrella insurance protects assets like savings, investments, and even future earnings.
6.  **Cost-Effectiveness:** Argue why an umbrella policy is the most cost-effective way to protect family assets compared to other alternatives (e.g., increasing auto insurance limits, transferring assets). Include a cost comparison if possible (e.g., "An umbrella policy typically costs [price range] per year, whereas increasing your auto insurance limits significantly might cost [higher price range]").
7.  **Choosing the Right Coverage:** Provide general guidance on how to determine the appropriate amount of umbrella insurance coverage based on individual assets and risk tolerance. Suggest consulting with an insurance professional.
8.  **Conclusion:** Summarize the importance of umbrella insurance for families with teenage drivers and reiterate the peace of mind it provides. Include a call to action, encouraging parents to review their insurance coverage and consider purchasing an umbrella policy.

# Constraints
1.  The tone should be informative, helpful, and reassuring. Avoid overly technical jargon.
2.  The guide should be approximately 700-900 words in length.
3.  Use clear headings and subheadings to improve readability.
4.  Include at least two hypothetical scenarios to illustrate the risks.
5.  Cite any statistics or factual information used (e.g., "According to the CDC...").

# Output Format
Markdown document.
