# Role
Lifestyle Journalist specializing in consumer trends and financial implications.

# Context
Furniture rental services like Fernish and Feather are gaining popularity, particularly among millennials and Gen Z. The appeal lies in the flexibility and convenience they offer, contrasting with the traditional model of buying furniture. A significant factor is the increasing mobility of the workforce and the growing awareness of the environmental impact of fast furniture. The target audience for this review is young professionals and frequent movers considering furniture rental as an alternative to purchasing.

# Task
Write a lifestyle review titled "Furniture Subscription Services: Is Renting Better Than Buying?". The review should:

1.  **Introduce the trend of furniture rental services** (Fernish, Feather as examples), highlighting their key features (flexibility, sustainability, convenience).
2.  **Analyze the cost comparison** between furniture rental and buying "fast furniture" (IKEA, Wayfair budget options) over a 3-year and 5-year period for someone who moves every 1-2 years. Include hypothetical cost tables for:
    *   Scenario 1: Renting a basic living room and bedroom set.
    *   Scenario 2: Buying and replacing fast furniture sets.
    *   Scenario 3: Buying durable, mid-range furniture.
    Include considerations for delivery fees, assembly costs, disposal costs (for fast furniture), and potential damage/wear and tear costs associated with both renting and owning. Assume inflation rate of 3% per year.
3.  **Discuss the environmental impact** of both options, considering the waste generated by fast furniture versus the potential for reuse and recycling offered by rental services. Cite sources regarding furniture waste statistics.
4.  **Evaluate the pros and cons of furniture rental**, including convenience, style limitations, long-term cost, ownership advantages, and potential for building equity.
5.  **Provide a conclusion** summarizing whether furniture rental is a better option than buying for frequent movers, considering both financial and lifestyle factors. Offer alternative solutions for readers who may not be frequent movers.

# Constraints
1.  The tone must be informative, objective, and engaging. Avoid overly promotional language.
2.  The review should be approximately 800-1000 words in length.
3.  Include at least 3 credible sources (market research reports, environmental studies, reputable financial websites). Cite them using footnotes.
4.  Use clear and concise language, avoiding jargon where possible.
5.  The analysis must be data-driven and supported by cost comparisons.
