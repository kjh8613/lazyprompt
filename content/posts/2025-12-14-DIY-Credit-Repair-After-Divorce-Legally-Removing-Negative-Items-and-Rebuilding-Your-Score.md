# Role
You are a Certified Financial Counselor and Consumer Protection Advocate with extensive expertise in U.S. credit law and divorce-related financial challenges.

# Context
An individual in the United States has recently finalized a divorce and is now facing the daunting task of repairing and rebuilding their credit score, which has been negatively impacted by shared debts, joint accounts, or inaccurate reporting post-separation. They need a detailed, actionable, and legally sound guide to navigate this process independently and ethically.

# Task
Generate a comprehensive, step-by-step guide titled "DIY Credit Repair After Divorce: Legally Removing Negative Items and Rebuilding Your Score." The guide must be practical, detailed, and empower the user to take control of their credit situation.

Your guide must cover the following sections and specific information:

**1. Introduction: Reclaiming Your Financial Future Post-Divorce**
*   Acknowledge the emotional and financial challenges.
*   Emphasize the importance of proactive credit repair.

**2. Understanding Your Credit Landscape After Divorce**
*   **Obtain Your Free Credit Reports:** Explain how to get reports from Equifax, Experian, and TransUnion via AnnualCreditReport.com.
*   **Thorough Review:** Guide on identifying specific issues:
    *   Joint accounts not properly closed or reassigned.
    *   Accounts assigned to an ex-spouse in the divorce decree but still on your report.
    *   Inaccurate late payments or balances.
    *   Unauthorized accounts or potential identity theft.
    *   Authorized user accounts from the ex-spouse.

**3. Key Consumer Protection Laws You Need to Know**
*   **Fair Credit Reporting Act (FCRA):**
    *   Your right to accurate information.
    *   Your right to dispute inaccuracies.
    *   Credit bureaus' obligation to investigate.
    *   Timeframes for investigation.
*   **Fair Debt Collection Practices Act (FDCPA):**
    *   Your rights against abusive debt collection practices.
    *   What debt collectors *cannot* do.
    *   Your right to request debt validation.
*   **Impact of Community Property Laws (for relevant states: AZ, CA, ID, LA, NV, NM, TX, WA, WI):**
    *   Explain how these laws can affect responsibility for marital debt even after divorce, regardless of who was assigned the debt in the decree.
    *   Differentiate between separate and marital debt.

**4. Step 1: Disputing Inaccurate Information with Credit Bureaus**
*   **Identify Specific Inaccuracies:** Provide examples of common post-divorce credit report errors.
*   **Gather Supporting Evidence:** List essential documents (divorce decree, payment records, communications, police reports for identity theft).
*   **Drafting a Dispute Letter:**
    *   Explain the importance of certified mail with return receipt.
    *   Provide a **TEMPLATE: FCRA Dispute Letter (General Inaccuracy)**. Include placeholders for personal info, account details, specific error, and requested action.
    *   Stress sending to all three major bureaus for each inaccuracy.
*   **Following Up on Disputes:** What to do if the bureaus don't respond within 30 days or deny the dispute.

**5. Step 2: Addressing Joint Accounts and Shared Debt Post-Divorce**
*   Explain that a divorce decree assigns responsibility between ex-spouses, but doesn't release either party from the original creditor agreement.
*   **Strategies:**
    *   Attempt to refinance/transfer debt to the assigned party's name.
    *   Negotiate directly with creditors, explaining the divorce situation.
    *   Actions if an ex-spouse defaults on debt assigned to them (e.g., contempt of court motions, but emphasize consulting an attorney).

**6. Step 3: Negotiating with Creditors for Debt Settlements**
*   **When to Consider:** For accounts in collections, or high balances you can't afford.
*   **Negotiation Tactics:**
    *   Offering a lump sum vs. a payment plan.
    *   "Pay-for-delete" strategy (with a strong cautionary note about its rarity and requiring written proof).
    *   Getting *everything* in writing before making a payment.
*   **Impact on Credit Score:** Explain that "settled for less than full amount" is still a negative mark, but better than charge-off or bankruptcy.

**7. Step 4: Stopping Harassing Debt Collectors**
*   **Your FDCPA Rights:** Reiterate key protections.
*   **Sending a Cease-and-Desist Letter:**
    *   Provide a **TEMPLATE: FDCPA Cease-and-Desist Letter**. Include options for requesting communication in writing only or to stop all communication.
    *   Explain certified mail.
*   **Reporting FDCPA Violations:** How to report to the CFPB and FTC.

**8. Step 5: Rebuilding Your Credit Score Proactively**
*   **Establishing New Credit Lines:**
    *   Secured credit cards (explain how they work).
    *   Credit-builder loans.
    *   Becoming an authorized user (with extreme caution and only with a trusted individual who manages credit well).
    *   Small, responsible installment loans (e.g., furniture, appliance).
*   **Cultivating Positive Credit Habits:**
    *   Pay all bills on time, every time.
    *   Keep credit utilization low (below 30%, ideally 10%).
    *   Monitor your credit regularly.
    *   Avoid opening too many new accounts at once.

**9. Budgeting and Financial Management Tips During Credit Repair**
*   Create a detailed post-divorce budget.
*   Establish an emergency fund.
*   Set clear financial goals.
*   Debt repayment strategies (e.g., debt snowball or avalanche method).
*   Consider financial counseling.

**10. Avoiding Scams and Predatory Lenders**
*   **Credit Repair Scams:** List red flags (upfront fees, guaranteed removal of negative items, instructing you to lie).
*   **Predatory Lenders:** Warn against payday loans, car title loans, and high-interest installment loans.
*   Reinforce the value of legal, ethical, and DIY methods.

**11. Conclusion: Your Path to Financial Independence**
*   Encourage persistence and patience.
*   Reiterate that rebuilding credit is a marathon, not a sprint.

## 💡 Pro Tips
1.  **Customize Placeholders:** For the dispute and cease-and-desist letter templates, replace bracketed placeholders like `[Your Name]`, `[Account Number]`, `[Creditor Name]`, and `[Date]` with your specific information before sending.
2.  **Provide Specifics for Better Results:** When actually writing your own letters, include as much specific detail as possible (e.g., exact dates of payments, specific paragraphs from your divorce decree, precise dates of alleged violations).
3.  **Recommended Model:** For best results in generating detailed, accurate, and structured guides, use advanced models like **GPT-4o, Claude 3.5 Sonnet, or Gemini 1.5 Pro**.
