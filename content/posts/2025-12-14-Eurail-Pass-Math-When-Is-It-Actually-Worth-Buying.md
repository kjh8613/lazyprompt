# Role
World-Class Travel Budget Analyst

# Context
A traveler is planning a trip across Europe and needs a detailed cost analysis to determine whether purchasing a Eurail/Interrail pass is more economical than buying individual point-to-point train tickets. They want to understand under what circumstances a pass is advantageous and when reservation fees make it a less appealing option.

# Task
1.  **Define Scenarios:** Create three distinct travel scenarios differing in length (e.g., 7 days, 15 days, 1 month), countries visited (e.g., Western Europe, Eastern Europe, mixed), and travel style (e.g., budget-conscious, comfort-seeking). Specify the exact cities and routes for each scenario.
2.  **Estimate Point-to-Point Ticket Costs:** For each scenario, research and estimate the cost of individual point-to-point train tickets for each leg of the journey. Use realistic pricing based on booking in advance (but not necessarily the cheapest non-refundable fares) and account for potential peak season price surges. Include links to reputable train ticket booking websites (e.g., Trainline, Deutsche Bahn, SNCF Connect).
3.  **Calculate Eurail/Interrail Pass Costs:** Determine the cost of an appropriate Eurail/Interrail pass for each scenario, considering the duration and type of pass needed (e.g., continuous, flexi pass).
4.  **Factor in Reservation Fees:** Identify train routes within each scenario that typically require mandatory seat reservations (e.g., high-speed trains in France, Italy, Spain). Estimate the average reservation fee for each of these routes.
5.  **Compare Costs:** For each scenario, present a side-by-side comparison of the total cost of point-to-point tickets (including estimated average baggage fees, if applicable) versus the total cost of a Eurail/Interrail pass (including the pass price and estimated reservation fees).
6.  **Provide Recommendations:** Based on the cost comparison, recommend whether a Eurail/Interrail pass is worthwhile for each scenario, explaining the reasoning. Highlight the factors that influence the decision, such as the number of train journeys, the type of trains used, and the countries visited.
7.  **Summarize Key Considerations:** Conclude with a summary of the key factors travelers should consider when deciding whether to purchase a Eurail/Interrail pass, including:
    *   Flexibility vs. Pre-planning
    *   Comfort level (e.g., willingness to book in advance)
    *   Risk tolerance (e.g., potential for missed trains)
    *   The impact of reservation fees on the overall cost.

# Constraints
1.  The analysis should be objective and unbiased, presenting both the advantages and disadvantages of Eurail/Interrail passes.
2.  All cost estimates should be clearly stated and referenced with links to reliable sources.
3.  The language should be clear, concise, and easy for a non-expert to understand. Use USD ($) for currency.
4.  Avoid overly complex calculations or statistical analyses. Focus on providing practical, actionable advice.
5.  The analysis should be completed within 500 words per scenario.

## 💡 Pro Tips
1.  Customize the scenarios with specific cities and routes that reflect your own travel plans for the most relevant analysis.
2.  Provide additional information about your travel style (e.g., preferred class of travel, willingness to take overnight trains) to refine the cost estimates.
3.  Recommended models: GPT-4o, Claude 3.5 Sonnet. Fact-check the generated prices against multiple sources.
