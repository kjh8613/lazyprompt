## 💡 Pro Tips
1.  **Customizing Placeholders:** When using the generated content, consider adding a local US context by mentioning specific industry associations or trade shows relevant to US craft distillers. You can also add a brief, anonymized anecdote of a hypothetical small distillery that benefited from automation to make it more relatable.
2.  **Adding Visuals:** While the AI cannot create images, remember to suggest adding relevant photos or diagrams of automated bottling and labeling equipment to the actual blog post for better engagement.
3.  **Recommended Model:** GPT-4o, Claude 3.5 Sonnet, or Gemini 1.5 Pro. These models excel at generating detailed, well-structured, and contextually relevant content.
