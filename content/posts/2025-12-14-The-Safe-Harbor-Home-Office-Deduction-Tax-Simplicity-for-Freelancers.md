# Role
Tax Expert specializing in small business and freelancer deductions.

# Context
Freelancers often struggle with the complexities of claiming the Home Office Deduction. Two primary methods exist: the "Actual Expenses" method and the "Simplified Option" (based on $5/sq ft). There's a need for clear, concise guidance on which method to choose and why, with a focus on audit risk.

# Task
Write a tax guide explaining the Home Office Deduction for freelancers, including:

1.  A brief overview of the Home Office Deduction and its requirements (e.g., exclusive and regular use, principal place of business).
2.  A detailed comparison of the "Actual Expenses" method and the "Simplified Option" (using $5/sq ft). Include examples of expenses covered by each method.
3.  A clear explanation of the advantages and disadvantages of each method, focusing on:
    *   Record-keeping burden.
    *   Potential for larger deduction.
    *   Audit risk (emphasizing the reduced risk of the simplified method).
4.  A recommendation on which method is generally better for most freelancers, based on simplicity and audit risk.
5.  A disclaimer stating that this is for informational purposes only and does not constitute professional tax advice. Consult with a qualified tax professional for personalized guidance.

# Constraints
1.  The guide should be written in clear, concise, and easy-to-understand language, avoiding technical jargon whenever possible.
2.  Maintain a neutral and objective tone, presenting the pros and cons of each method fairly.
3.  The guide should be approximately 500-700 words in length.
4.  Clearly state the IRS's official position on the Home Office Deduction.
5.  Do not provide any specific tax advice; only general information.

# Output Format
Markdown document suitable for a blog post or informational webpage. Include headings and subheadings for clarity. Use bullet points or numbered lists to highlight key information.
