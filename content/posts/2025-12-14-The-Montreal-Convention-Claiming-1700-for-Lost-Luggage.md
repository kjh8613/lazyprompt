# Role
Travel Legal Expert specializing in international air passenger rights and consumer advocacy.

# Context
Airlines frequently lose or delay passenger baggage, causing significant inconvenience and financial burden. Many travelers are unaware of their rights under the Montreal Convention, a treaty designed to protect air travelers' interests. This guide aims to educate passengers on claiming compensation for reasonable expenses incurred due to delayed, lost, or damaged luggage.

# Task
Write a comprehensive "Travel Rights Guide" on the Montreal Convention, specifically focusing on claiming compensation for lost luggage. The guide should include the following sections:

1.  **Introduction to the Montreal Convention:** Briefly explain the Montreal Convention as an international treaty governing airline liability for passenger injury, death, and baggage loss or delay. Highlight its purpose of standardizing and simplifying compensation for travelers.
2.  **Coverage of the Montreal Convention:** Clarify which flights and airlines are covered by the Montreal Convention. Specifically mention that it applies to international flights between countries that are signatories (most major countries are).
3.  **Your Rights When Luggage is Lost or Delayed:** Detail the rights of passengers when their luggage is lost, delayed, or damaged. Explain that passengers are entitled to compensation for reasonable expenses incurred as a result of the delay, such as the purchase of essential clothing and toiletries.
4.  **How Much Can You Claim?** Explain the maximum liability limits under the Montreal Convention (approximately $1,700 USD, but specify the SDR equivalent and explain that it fluctuates with exchange rates). Emphasize that this is the *maximum*, and the actual amount claimed depends on the passenger's documented expenses.
5.  **What Expenses Are Covered?** Provide examples of reasonable expenses that are typically covered, such as clothing, toiletries, essential medications, and other necessary items. Clearly state that receipts are crucial for substantiating claims.
6.  **Making a Claim: Step-by-Step Guide:** Provide a detailed, step-by-step guide on how to file a claim with the airline for lost or delayed luggage under the Montreal Convention. Include:
    *   Immediately reporting the loss or delay at the airport.
    *   Filing a Property Irregularity Report (PIR).
    *   Retaining copies of all travel documents (boarding pass, baggage tags, etc.).
    *   Collecting receipts for all expenses incurred.
    *   Submitting a written claim to the airline within the required timeframe (21 days for delayed baggage, 7 days for damaged baggage, and explain the time limit for considering baggage lost).
    *   Following up with the airline if a response is not received within a reasonable timeframe.
7.  **Proving Your Loss:** Explain the importance of providing sufficient evidence to support the claim. This includes receipts, photographs (if applicable for damaged luggage), and any other documentation that demonstrates the expenses incurred.
8.  **What if the Airline Denies My Claim?** Outline the steps passengers can take if the airline denies their claim, including escalating the complaint to consumer protection agencies, aviation regulatory bodies, or pursuing legal action as a last resort. Provide examples of relevant regulatory bodies (e.g., Department of Transportation in the US, Civil Aviation Authority in the UK).
9.  **Tips for Avoiding Luggage Problems:** Offer practical tips to minimize the risk of luggage loss or delay, such as:
    *   Using luggage trackers.
    *   Taking photos of your luggage and its contents.
    *   Removing old baggage tags.
    *   Arriving at the airport early.
    *   Using durable luggage.
10. **Conclusion:** Summarize the key takeaways and reiterate the importance of knowing your rights under the Montreal Convention.

# Constraints
*   The guide should be written in clear, concise, and easy-to-understand language for a general audience. Avoid overly technical jargon.
*   Maintain a helpful and informative tone, empowering travelers to assert their rights.
*   Be accurate and up-to-date with current regulations and best practices.
*   The guide should be approximately 800-1200 words.
*   Include relevant website/resource links (use placeholders e.g., [Airline Claim Form Link]) where applicable, to be filled in later.

# Output Format
Markdown document structured with headings and subheadings for each section, including bullet points where appropriate to enhance readability.

## 💡 Pro Tips
1. Customize the "[Airline Claim Form Link]" placeholders with actual links to airline claim forms or relevant resources for specific airlines or countries.
2. You can provide the AI with specific airline names or countries to tailor the guide further. This will allow it to reference common airline practices or consumer laws specific to that region.
3. Recommended model: GPT-4 or Claude 3 Opus for optimal accuracy and writing quality.
