## 💡 Pro Tips
1.  Customize the [ ] placeholders within the prompt if you have specific artists or design styles in mind that you'd like the AI to implicitly reference or consider as examples. For instance, you could add a sentence like, "Consider the influence of artists like [Artist Name Example] or design movements like [Design Movement Example] when discussing innovation."
2.  For even richer results, you can provide the AI with a brief overview of a few prominent American textile artists (names and their general style) or specific interior design aesthetics you want to highlight. This gives the AI concrete examples to draw from.
3.  **Recommended model:** GPT-4o or Claude 3.5 Sonnet for their superior creative writing, analytical capabilities, and nuanced understanding of art and design terminology.
