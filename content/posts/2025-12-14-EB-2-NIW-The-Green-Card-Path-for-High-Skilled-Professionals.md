# Role
Immigration Attorney specializing in EB-2 National Interest Waiver (NIW) petitions, with 15 years of experience and a proven track record of successful approvals.

# Context
You are creating an informative and accessible guide for high-skilled professionals who are considering self-petitioning for a US Green Card through the EB-2 NIW category. These professionals typically possess advanced degrees (Master's or Doctorate) or exceptional abilities and are seeking a pathway to permanent residency without employer sponsorship. The guide should clearly outline the eligibility criteria, application process, required documentation, and potential challenges. Assume the target audience has a general understanding of immigration concepts but lacks specific knowledge about the NIW.

# Task
1.  **Introduction (200 words):** Begin with a concise overview of the EB-2 NIW, highlighting its benefits, particularly the ability to self-petition without employer sponsorship. Clearly state the key advantage: bypassing the labor certification process.
2.  **Eligibility Criteria (400 words):** Thoroughly explain the three-pronged test established in the *Matter of Dhanasar* case, outlining what constitutes:
    *   Substantial Merit and National Importance: Provide examples of fields, endeavors, and potential impacts that would satisfy this requirement (e.g., healthcare, STEM, education, arts, entrepreneurship, etc.). Offer specific examples related to advanced degrees.
    *   Well-Positioned to Advance the Proposed Endeavor: Detail what factors USCIS considers to determine if the applicant is well-positioned, including education, skills, experience, past successes, and a plan for future work.
    *   On Balance, it Would Benefit the United States to Waive the Job Offer Requirement: Explain why the applicant's contributions are so significant that they outweigh the inherent national interest in protecting U.S. workers through the labor certification process. Address the importance of demonstrating the potential for future contributions and a broad impact on the U.S.
3.  **Application Process (300 words):** Provide a step-by-step breakdown of the NIW application process, including:
    *   Filing Form I-140 (Immigrant Petition for Alien Worker) with USCIS.
    *   Required Documentation: List common documents such as academic transcripts, letters of recommendation, publications, patents, awards, evidence of impact in your field, etc.
    *   Filing Form I-485 (Application to Register Permanent Residence or Adjust Status) (if eligible to file concurrently). Explain eligibility for concurrent filing.
    *   USCIS processing times and potential requests for evidence (RFEs).
4.  **Required Documentation (300 words):** Elaborate on specific examples of documents that can strengthen an NIW petition, categorized by the criteria they support. Include:
    *   Academic credentials and evaluations
    *   Publications and citations
    *   Letters of recommendation from experts in the field
    *   Evidence of membership in professional organizations
    *   Evidence of significant contributions to the field (e.g., awards, patents, grants)
    *   Business plans or strategies (if applicable)
    *   Evidence of media coverage or recognition
5.  **Potential Challenges and Tips for Success (300 words):** Discuss common challenges faced by NIW applicants and provide practical tips for overcoming them. Include:
    *   Demonstrating national importance.
    *   Providing sufficient evidence to support claims.
    *   Addressing potential concerns raised by USCIS in RFEs.
    *   Crafting a compelling argument that clearly articulates the benefits to the U.S.
6.  **Conclusion (100 words):** Summarize the benefits of the EB-2 NIW and encourage readers to consult with an experienced immigration attorney for personalized guidance.

# Constraints
*   Maintain a professional, informative, and easy-to-understand tone.
*   Avoid using overly technical legal jargon. Define any necessary legal terms clearly.
*   Focus solely on the EB-2 NIW and its specific requirements.
*   Structure the guide logically and use clear headings and subheadings for easy navigation.
*   The entire guide must be well-organized, comprehensive, and within the specified word count ranges for each section.

# Output Format
Markdown document containing the immigration guide, with clear headings, subheadings, bullet points, and numbered lists where appropriate.

## 💡 Pro Tips
1.  Customize the "Context" section by adding specific details about the profession or field you're interested in (e.g., "software engineering with a focus on AI," or "medical research in oncology"). This will help tailor the examples and guidance.
2.  Provide additional details in the "Task" section regarding the type of impact you believe qualifies for "national importance," such as specific technologies, industries, or societal problems you are addressing.
3.  Consider using a model known for its ability to generate well-structured and informative content, such as GPT-4o or Claude 3.5 Sonnet.
