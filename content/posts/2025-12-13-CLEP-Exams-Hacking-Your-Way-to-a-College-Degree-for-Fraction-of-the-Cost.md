# Role
Experienced Education Blogger specializing in college cost-saving strategies and alternative learning pathways.

# Context
Many students are burdened by the high cost of college tuition, particularly for introductory courses that often cover material already known to them. The College-Level Examination Program (CLEP) offers a solution, allowing students to earn college credit by demonstrating proficiency through exams, bypassing the need to take and pay for the corresponding courses.

# Task
Write a blog post titled "CLEP Exams: Hacking Your Way to a College Degree for a Fraction of the Cost". The blog post should:

1.  **Introduce CLEP:** Clearly explain what CLEP is, who administers it (College Board), and its primary purpose: to allow students to earn college credit for prior learning.
2.  **Explain the Cost Savings:** Emphasize the financial benefits of CLEP exams, contrasting the $90 (or slightly more, depending on proctoring fees) exam cost with the potentially thousands of dollars saved in tuition for a single 3-credit course. Provide a concrete example of potential savings.
3.  **Outline the CLEP Exam Process:** Detail the steps involved in taking a CLEP exam, including:
    *   Choosing a CLEP exam that aligns with the student's knowledge and the college's requirements.
    *   Studying for the exam using recommended resources (official study guides, online courses, practice tests).
    *   Registering for and taking the exam at an authorized testing center.
    *   Sending the scores to the desired college or university.
4.  **Highlight Benefits Beyond Cost:** Discuss advantages beyond just financial savings, such as:
    *   Accelerated degree completion.
    *   Opportunity to focus on more advanced coursework.
    *   Increased motivation and confidence.
5.  **Provide Practical Tips for Success:** Offer actionable advice for students preparing for CLEP exams, including:
    *   Assessing their existing knowledge through practice tests.
    *   Creating a study schedule and sticking to it.
    *   Utilizing a variety of study resources.
    *   Understanding the exam format and question types.
6.  **Include a Call to Action:** Encourage readers to research CLEP exams relevant to their field of study and to explore the possibility of earning college credit through this method.

# Constraints
1.  The tone should be informative, encouraging, and accessible to a broad audience of students and their parents.
2.  Avoid overly technical jargon and explain concepts in plain language.
3.  The blog post should be approximately 700-900 words in length.
4.  Maintain a positive and enthusiastic tone about the potential of CLEP exams.
5.  Include a clear disclaimer stating that credit acceptance varies by institution and students should confirm CLEP policies with their chosen college or university.

# Output Format
Markdown blog post with the specified title and sections covering all the points outlined in the Task. Include headings and subheadings for readability.
