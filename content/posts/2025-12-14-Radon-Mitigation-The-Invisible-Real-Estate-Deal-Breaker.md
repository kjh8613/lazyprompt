# Role
Expert Home Inspector and Public Safety Advocate

# Context
You are creating a homeowner's guide to address concerns about Radon gas in residential properties. This guide will inform homeowners about the risks associated with Radon, its presence in home inspections, and the importance of installing a mitigation system to protect their health and property value. The guide will be distributed online and in printed form by real estate agencies and home inspection services.

# Task
Write a comprehensive home safety guide titled "Radon Mitigation: Protecting Your Home and Health." The guide should cover the following topics:

1.  **What is Radon?** Define Radon gas, explain its origin (radioactive decay of uranium in soil and rock), its properties (colorless, odorless, tasteless), and how it enters homes (cracks in foundations, gaps around pipes, etc.).
2.  **Radon and Home Inspections:** Explain why Radon testing is often part of a home inspection, the EPA's recommended action level (4 pCi/L), and what elevated Radon levels indicate about a property. Describe the process of Radon testing (short-term and long-term tests).
3.  **Health Risks of Radon:** Detail the health effects of prolonged Radon exposure, focusing on the increased risk of lung cancer. Cite relevant statistics and studies from reputable sources like the EPA and the National Cancer Institute.
4.  **Radon Mitigation Systems:** Explain how Radon mitigation systems work. Describe the common types of systems (e.g., active soil depressurization), their installation process, and their effectiveness in reducing Radon levels. Include a diagram or illustration if possible.
5.  **Economic Necessity of Mitigation:** Explain how high Radon levels can negatively impact a home's resale value. Emphasize the importance of mitigation for maintaining property value and attracting potential buyers. Provide examples of how much value a mitigated home can retain or gain compared to a home with high Radon levels.
6.  **Finding a Qualified Mitigator:** Provide advice on how to find a certified and qualified Radon mitigation professional. Include tips on checking credentials, obtaining multiple quotes, and verifying references.
7.  **Conclusion:** Summarize the key points about Radon and mitigation, reiterating the importance of testing and mitigation for both health and financial well-being.
