# Role
Experienced Real Estate Blogger specializing in the New York City market.

# Context
Many prospective homebuyers, particularly in competitive markets like NYC, are confused about the fundamental differences between co-ops and condos. This lack of understanding can lead to costly mistakes. Create a blog post that clearly explains these differences, focusing on the financial aspects of "shares" versus "real property" ownership, and the implications of the stricter board approval process associated with co-ops.

# Task
1.  **Introduction:** Start with an engaging introduction highlighting the common confusion between co-ops and condos, especially in cities like NYC. Clearly state the blog post's purpose: to demystify the financial and structural differences.
2.  **Condos: Real Property Explained:** Define condo ownership as owning "real property." Explain what this means legally and financially, including the ability to mortgage, sell, and lease the property relatively freely. Mention typical condo fees and what they cover.
3.  **Co-ops: Shares in a Corporation Explained:** Define co-op ownership as buying "shares" in a corporation that owns the building. Explain that you are not directly owning real property, but rather a proprietary lease to occupy a specific unit. Elaborate on the concept of a "share loan" (mortgage equivalent) and how it differs from a traditional mortgage.
4.  **Financial Implications: Shares vs. Real Property:** Compare and contrast the financial implications of each ownership type. Discuss aspects like:
    *   Resale value considerations.
    *   Financing options and lender perspectives (more restrictive lending practices for co-ops).
    *   Monthly maintenance fees (typically higher in co-ops) and what they cover (including underlying mortgage for the building).
    *   The potential for flip taxes or transfer fees upon sale.
5.  **The Board Approval Process:** Explain the significantly stricter board approval process for co-ops compared to condos. Detail common co-op board requirements, such as:
    *   Financial stability (low debt-to-income ratio).
    *   Proof of sufficient post-closing liquidity.
    *   Personal interviews.
    *   Letters of recommendation.
    *   Board’s discretionary power to reject applicants. Contrast this with the more straightforward (and often absent) approval process for condo purchases.
6.  **NYC Market Focus:**  Tailor the information to the NYC market, providing relevant examples and statistics where possible. Mention that co-ops are a more prevalent housing type in NYC compared to many other cities.
7.  **Conclusion:** Summarize the key differences between co-ops and condos, reiterating the importance of understanding these differences before making a purchase decision. Encourage readers to consult with a real estate professional for personalized advice.

# Constraints
*   **Tone:** Informative, objective, and easy to understand for a general audience. Avoid overly technical jargon.
*   **Length:** Aim for approximately 700-900 words.
*   **Accuracy:** Ensure all information is factually correct and up-to-date.
*   **Originality:**  The content must be original and not plagiarized.
*   **Formatting:** Use headings, subheadings, and bullet points to improve readability.

# Output Format
Markdown blog post.
