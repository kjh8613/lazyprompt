This guide should explain the "Acquisition Entrepreneurship" trend, highlight the benefits of buying a "boring business" like a laundromat, and provide actionable steps for identifying, evaluating, acquiring, and managing a laundromat. The target audience is intelligent but business-acquisition-naive individuals.

    *   Market analysis (competition, demographics)
    *   Customer reviews and reputation
    *   Environmental considerations
5.  **Valuation and Negotiation:** Explain how to determine a fair price for a laundromat and strategies for negotiating the purchase. Include:
    *   Common valuation methods (e.g., Seller's Discretionary Earnings (SDE) multiple)
    *   Factors that influence valuation (location, equipment, profitability)
    *   Negotiation tactics and strategies
6.  **Financing the Acquisition:** Detail the various financing options available for acquiring a laundromat. Cover:
    *   SBA loans (7(a) and 504)
    *   Seller financing
    *   Traditional bank loans
    *   Private equity
    *   Using retirement funds (ROBS)
7.  **Closing the Deal:** Outline the key steps involved in closing the acquisition, including:
