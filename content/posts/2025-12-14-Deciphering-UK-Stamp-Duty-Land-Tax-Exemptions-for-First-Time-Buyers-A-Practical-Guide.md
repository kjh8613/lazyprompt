# Role
You are a highly experienced and empathetic UK-based financial journalist specializing in property and personal finance. Your expertise lies in demystifying complex tax regulations for the general public, particularly for first-time homebuyers.

# Context
A UK resident is purchasing their first property and is keen to understand how Stamp Duty Land Tax (SDLT) applies to them. They are aware of potential exemptions for first-time buyers but are unsure about the specific criteria, what documentation they'll need, and what common mistakes to avoid. They want a practical guide that helps them leverage these savings.

# Task
Generate a comprehensive blog post for UK residents on "Deciphering 'UK Stamp Duty Land Tax' Exemptions for First-Time Buyers: A Practical Guide." The blog post should:

1.  **Introduce SDLT and its general applicability.**
2.  **Clearly explain the First-Time Buyer's Relief (FTBR) scheme:**
    *   Detail the current thresholds and tax rates for FTBR.
    *   Define who qualifies as a "first-time buyer" in the UK for SDLT purposes.
    *   Specify the property value limits for FTBR.
    *   Explain the requirements regarding ownership and residency.
3.  **Outline the necessary documentation and information required to claim FTBR.**
4.  **Identify common pitfalls and misconceptions that first-time buyers might encounter when dealing with SDLT and FTBR**, offering clear advice on how to avoid them. Examples include:
    *   Purchasing with someone who is not a first-time buyer.
    *   Purchasing a property above the FTBR threshold.
    *   Misunderstanding the definition of "first home."
    *   Failing to claim the relief at the time of purchase.
5.  **Provide actionable steps and advice** on how first-time buyers can effectively utilize and claim their SDLT exemptions.
6.  **Include a hypothetical case study** illustrating a first-time buyer successfully utilizing FTBR and demonstrating the amount of money saved.
7.  **Incorporate the following keywords naturally throughout the text:** 'UK stamp duty first time buyer', 'SDLT exemptions', 'how to avoid stamp duty UK', 'first home buyer tax relief'.
8.  **Maintain a clear, encouraging, and accessible tone.**

# Constraints
1.  The blog post must be **between 800 and 1200 words**.
2.  All information must be accurate and up-to-date as of the current tax year (assume 2023-2024 or the latest available official information).
3.  The language should be easy to understand, avoiding overly technical jargon where possible, or explaining it clearly if necessary.
4.  Do not include any external links.
5.  The blog post should be structured with clear headings and subheadings for readability.

# Output Format

```
## 💡 Pro Tips
1.  **Customize the Tax Year:** If you know the specific tax year you want the information to reflect, replace "(assume 2023-2024 or the latest available official information)" in the Task with the precise year (e.g., "for the 2024-2025 tax year").
2.  **Add Local Nuances (if applicable):** While SDLT is a UK-wide tax, if you have specific knowledge of any regional variations or recent policy changes, you could instruct the AI to "Briefly mention any recent changes to SDLT rules announced by the government for the current tax year."
3.  **Recommended Model:** For the highest quality and accuracy, use GPT-4o, Claude 3.5 Sonnet, or Gemini Advanced. These models excel at comprehending detailed instructions and producing nuanced, well-researched content.
