# Role
Real Estate Tax Expert & Senior Financial Writer

# Context
You are writing a comprehensive guide for real estate investors explaining Section 1031 "Like-Kind Exchanges" under U.S. tax law. Many investors seek strategies to defer capital gains taxes when selling investment properties and reinvesting in new ones. The guide needs to be accessible to both seasoned investors and those new to the concept.

# Task
1.  **Introduction:** Begin with a clear, concise definition of a Section 1031 "Like-Kind Exchange." Explain its primary purpose: deferring capital gains taxes.
2.  **Eligibility Requirements:** Describe the specific criteria a property must meet to qualify for a 1031 exchange (e.g., held for productive use in trade or business or for investment). Clearly differentiate between properties that qualify and those that do not (e.g., personal residences).
3.  **"Like-Kind" Definition:** Define what "like-kind" means in the context of a 1031 exchange. Explain that "like-kind" refers to the nature or character of the property, not its grade or quality. Provide examples of acceptable and unacceptable property exchanges. For instance, exchanging an apartment building for raw land is typically acceptable, but exchanging real property for personal property is not.
4.  **Step-by-Step Process:** Outline the step-by-step process of completing a 1031 exchange, including:
    *   **Identifying a Qualified Intermediary (QI):** Explain the role of a QI and why it's crucial.
    *   **Sale of the Relinquished Property:** Describe the process of selling the property.
    *   **Identification Period:** Detail the 45-day identification period requirement, including rules for identifying potential replacement properties. Explain the 3-property rule, the 200% rule, and the 95% rule for identifying multiple properties.
    *   **Acquisition Period:** Describe the 180-day acquisition period requirement, including the deadline for completing the purchase of the replacement property.
    *   **Purchase of the Replacement Property:** Detail the process of acquiring the new property through the QI.
5.  **"Boot" and its Tax Implications:** Explain the concept of "boot" (e.g., cash, mortgage relief) received during the exchange and how it can trigger partial capital gains taxes. Provide examples.
6.  **Reverse Exchanges & Build-to-Suit Exchanges:** Briefly explain reverse exchanges (acquiring the replacement property before selling the relinquished property) and build-to-suit exchanges (using exchange funds to improve the replacement property).
7.  **Tax Implications & Reporting:** Summarize the tax implications of a 1031 exchange, emphasizing the deferral of capital gains taxes. Explain the reporting requirements on IRS Form 8824.
8.  **Potential Risks & Considerations:** Discuss potential pitfalls or challenges associated with 1031 exchanges, such as market fluctuations, finding suitable replacement properties, and strict deadlines.
9.  **Disclaimer:** Include a disclaimer stating that this guide is for informational purposes only and does not constitute professional tax or legal advice. Readers should consult with qualified professionals.

# Constraints
1.  Maintain a clear, concise, and easy-to-understand writing style, avoiding overly technical jargon.
2.  The guide should be comprehensive, covering all major aspects of a 1031 exchange, but remain focused on practical application for real estate investors.
3.  Use bullet points, numbered lists, and headings to improve readability and organization.
4.  Provide realistic examples to illustrate key concepts and rules.
5.  The tone should be informative and helpful, building trust with the reader.

# Output Format
Markdown document suitable for publishing as a blog post or downloadable guide. Include clear headings, subheadings, bulleted lists, and numbered steps where appropriate.
