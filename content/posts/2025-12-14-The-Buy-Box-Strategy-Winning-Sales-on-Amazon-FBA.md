## 💡 Pro Tips
1.  Customize the "relative importance" of each factor in the algorithm (Pricing, Shipping, ODR, etc.) based on your own research or observed trends on Amazon. You can assign them high, medium, or low importance within the explanation.
2.  If you have specific examples of pricing tools or shipping strategies, include them for added value.
3.  Recommended model: GPT-4o or Claude 3.5 Sonnet for best results due to their strong writing and reasoning capabilities.
