# Role
Sustainability Expert and DIY Home Improvement Writer

# Context
Homeowners are increasingly interested in sustainable practices that reduce their environmental impact and lower utility bills. Laundry-to-landscape greywater systems offer a legal and effective way to reuse laundry water for irrigation, particularly beneficial for fruit trees. Regulations vary by location, making understanding legal requirements critical.

# Task
Create a comprehensive guide titled "Grey Water Systems: Legally Reusing Laundry Water for Gardens" covering the following:

1.  **Introduction:** Briefly explain the concept of greywater and its benefits (environmental, cost-saving). Mention the specific focus on Laundry-to-Landscape systems and fruit tree irrigation.
2.  **Legal Considerations:** Explain that greywater regulations vary significantly by region (country, state/province, city). Provide a disclaimer that readers MUST check their local regulations before installing any system. Include a general outline of common regulations (e.g., prohibited substances, minimum setback distances from property lines/wells, permit requirements). Link to a resource for finding local greywater regulations (e.g., a website or organization).
3.  **System Overview: Laundry-to-Landscape:** Describe how a Laundry-to-Landscape system works. Include a simple diagram illustrating the system (washing machine, diverter valve, piping, mulch basin). Explain the basic components.
4.  **Materials List:** Provide a detailed list of materials required for a basic Laundry-to-Landscape system. Include estimated costs for each item (e.g., Diverter valve: \$[Price], PVC pipes: \$[Price]/foot, etc.). Specify tool requirements.
5.  **Step-by-Step Installation Guide:** Provide detailed, easy-to-understand instructions with clear steps and visual aids. Include the following steps:
    *   Planning the Layout (considering tree locations, slope, etc.)
    *   Installing the Diverter Valve (with photos/diagrams)
    *   Running the Piping (emphasizing proper slope and avoiding leaks)
    *   Creating Mulch Basins (explaining size and location relative to trees)
    *   Testing the System (checking for leaks and proper drainage)
6.  **Best Practices for Greywater Use:** Outline guidelines for safe and effective greywater use:
    *   Suitable and unsuitable soaps/detergents (avoiding boron, salts, etc.). List specific examples of greywater-safe products.
    *   Watering schedules and volume recommendations (avoiding overwatering).
    *   Maintenance tips (checking for leaks, cleaning filters, etc.).
    *   Troubleshooting common problems (e.g., clogs, odors).
7.  **Benefits and Cost Savings:** Quantify the potential water bill savings based on average laundry water usage. Discuss the environmental benefits (reduced water consumption, less strain on water resources).
8.  **Conclusion:** Reiterate the benefits of greywater systems and encourage readers to implement sustainable practices.

# Constraints
*   The guide must be written in a clear, concise, and easy-to-understand language suitable for homeowners with limited plumbing experience.
*   The guide MUST include a strong disclaimer about the importance of checking local regulations.
*   Avoid technical jargon where possible. When necessary, define terms clearly.
*   Use US customary units (inches, feet, gallons).
*   Maintain a positive and encouraging tone, emphasizing the ease and benefits of greywater systems.

## 💡 Pro Tips
1.  Replace the bracketed placeholders like "[Price]" and "[Specific type and size]" with actual values and details for a more realistic and helpful guide. The more detail you provide, the better the output.
2.  If you have specific knowledge about greywater regulations in your area, include that information in the context to further tailor the guide.
3.  I recommend using GPT-4o or Claude 3.5 Sonnet for this prompt, as they are excellent at generating detailed and well-structured content. You can also ask for code-compatible sections for Javascript or PHP, for website application.
