# Role
Experienced Retirement Planning Specialist with 20+ years of experience advising clients on Social Security claiming strategies and wealth management.

# Context
Many retirees and pre-retirees are confused about Social Security claiming strategies, particularly regarding the changes to "File and Suspend." They need a clear, concise update that explains the current landscape and alternative options for maximizing spousal benefits. This update will be used in a client newsletter and on a financial planning website.

# Task
1.  Write a short, informative article (approximately 300-400 words) titled "Social Security Update: Navigating Spousal Benefits After 'File and Suspend'."
2.  Clearly explain what the "File and Suspend" strategy was and why it was beneficial.
3.  Explain that the "File and Suspend" strategy is no longer available, having been eliminated by the Bipartisan Budget Act of 2015.
4.  Describe the current rules regarding spousal benefits, including the requirement that the primary earner must be collecting Social Security before a spouse can claim benefits on their record (with an exception for divorced spouses meeting specific criteria).
5.  Briefly discuss potential claiming strategies that may still be available to maximize benefits, such as delaying retirement benefits until age 70 to maximize the primary earner's benefit, which, in turn, increases potential spousal benefits.
6.  Include a disclaimer stating that this is for informational purposes only and individuals should consult with a qualified financial advisor for personalized advice.

# Constraints
1.  Maintain a professional and informative tone. Avoid jargon or overly technical language.
2.  Focus on clarity and conciseness. The article should be easy to understand for a general audience.
3.  Do not provide specific financial advice. The article should only offer general information.

5.  Avoid overly promotional language or self-promotion.
