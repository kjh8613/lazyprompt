# Context
Many renters and apartment dwellers are interested in reducing their carbon footprint and lowering their electricity bills, but they cannot install solar panels on their roofs. Community solar projects offer a viable solution, allowing individuals to subscribe to a local solar farm and receive credits on their electricity bills based on the solar farm's production. You are tasked with creating a comprehensive guide to explain community solar and how renters can participate.

# Task
1.  **Define Community Solar:** Clearly explain what community solar is and how it differs from traditional rooftop solar.
2.  **Explain the Benefits:** Describe the environmental and financial benefits of participating in community solar, specifically for renters.
3.  **Eligibility Criteria:** Outline typical eligibility requirements for subscribing to a community solar project (e.g., location, credit score).
4.  **How to Subscribe:** Provide a step-by-step guide on how renters can find and subscribe to a community solar project in their area, including resources for finding reputable providers.
5.  **Cost and Savings:** Explain how the billing process works, including how credits are applied to electricity bills and potential savings. Address potential upfront costs or subscription fees.
6.  **Address Common Concerns:** Discuss frequently asked questions or concerns about community solar, such as contract terms, portability (moving), and reliability.
7.  **Call to Action:** Encourage renters to explore community solar options and provide links to relevant resources and organizations.

# Constraints
1.  The guide should be written in a clear, concise, and easy-to-understand language, avoiding technical jargon where possible.
2.  Focus on providing practical information relevant to renters and apartment dwellers.
3.  Maintain a positive and encouraging tone, highlighting the accessibility and benefits of community solar.
