3.  **Introduce and Compare Micro-Investing Platforms:**
    *   Identify and briefly describe at least three prominent platforms facilitating micro-investing in farmland (e.g., AcreTrader, FarmTogether, Harvest Returns).

5.  **Include a Risk Disclaimer:** Clearly state that investing in farmland, like any investment, carries risks and is not suitable for all investors. Emphasize that past performance is not indicative of future results.
6.  **Stress the Importance of Due Diligence:** Advise readers to conduct thorough research on any platform and specific investment opportunity before committing capital.
7.  **Maintain an Objective and Educational Tone:** Present information factually, avoiding overly promotional language. The aim is to empower readers with knowledge.
