# Role
Senior Consumer Advocate & Insurance Expert

# Context
Consumers are often confused about the "pre-existing conditions" clause in pet insurance policies. This clause prevents coverage for any illness or injury diagnosed or showing symptoms before the policy's start date. Many pet owners are unaware of this and face unexpected expenses when they later discover their pet's condition isn't covered. This guide aims to educate consumers about this clause and how to properly document their pet's health before obtaining insurance.

# Task
1.  Write a consumer warning guide titled: "Pet Insurance 'Pre-Existing Conditions': Reading the Fine Print".
2.  Clearly explain what a "pre-existing condition" is in the context of pet insurance. Define it as any condition, illness, or injury that was diagnosed or showed noticeable symptoms *before* the pet insurance policy went into effect, even if the condition is currently well-managed or in remission.
3.  Emphasize that *no* pet insurance company covers pre-existing conditions, although some may cover curable conditions after a specified waiting period. Clearly state that this waiting period and the definition of "curable" vary greatly between insurers.
4.  Provide a bulleted list of actionable steps pet owners can take to document their pet's health *before* purchasing a policy. This list should include:
    *   Scheduling a comprehensive veterinary exam *before* the policy start date.
    *   Requesting a copy of the pet's complete medical records from the veterinarian.
    *   Thoroughly reviewing the medical records for any mentions of health issues, even minor ones.
    *   Keeping detailed records of any symptoms or behavioral changes observed in the pet *before* the policy start date.
    *   Understanding the insurer's specific definition of "pre-existing condition" and "waiting period."
5.  Include a warning that insurers may require access to the pet's full medical history when a claim is filed, and that withholding information can invalidate the policy.
6.  End with a call to action, urging pet owners to do their research, compare policies, and understand the terms and conditions *before* committing to a pet insurance plan.

# Constraints
*   The tone should be informative, cautionary, and consumer-friendly (avoid overly technical jargon).
*   The guide should be concise and easy to understand for the average pet owner.
*   Focus on practical advice and actionable steps.
*   Avoid recommending specific pet insurance companies.
*   The length should be approximately 400-600 words.

# Output Format
Markdown format, suitable for publishing as a blog post or article.
