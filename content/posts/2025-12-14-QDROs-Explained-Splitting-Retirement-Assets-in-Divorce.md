# Role
Expert Legal and Financial Writer specializing in family law and retirement planning.

# Context
Many divorcing couples need to divide retirement assets like 401(k)s, pensions, and other qualified plans. A standard divorce decree is generally insufficient for instructing a plan administrator on how to distribute these assets to a former spouse without triggering significant tax liabilities. A Qualified Domestic Relations Order (QDRO) is a specialized court order designed for this purpose.

# Task
Write a comprehensive guide explaining QDROs, addressing the following points:

1.  **Definition and Purpose of a QDRO:** Clearly define what a QDRO is and its specific purpose in the context of divorce. Explain why it is needed to divide qualified retirement plans.
2.  **Why a Divorce Decree is Insufficient:** Explain in detail why a standard divorce decree is not enough to divide a 401(k) or other qualified retirement plan without triggering taxes and penalties. Discuss the tax implications if a QDRO is not used.
3.  **Types of Retirement Plans Covered:** List the types of retirement plans that can be divided using a QDRO (e.g., 401(k), 403(b), pension plans, etc.). Briefly explain if and how governmental plans differ.
4.  **Key Components of a QDRO:** Describe the essential elements that must be included in a QDRO to be considered "qualified" by the plan administrator (e.g., names, addresses, plan name, specific allocation instructions, etc.).
5.  **QDRO Process Step-by-Step:** Outline the typical steps involved in obtaining and implementing a QDRO:
    *   Drafting the QDRO
    *   Submitting it to the Plan Administrator for pre-approval
    *   Obtaining court approval/signature
    *   Submitting the approved QDRO to the Plan Administrator for implementation
6.  **Tax Implications of Using a QDRO:** Explain the tax advantages of using a QDRO. Specifically, detail how the transfer of assets under a QDRO is *not* considered a taxable event and how the recipient spouse can avoid immediate taxation. Describe options for receiving assets (e.g., rollover to IRA, distribution).
7.  **Potential Pitfalls and Considerations:** Discuss common mistakes or issues that can arise during the QDRO process (e.g., improper drafting, plan administrator rejection, delays in implementation, understanding investment options within the plan).
8.  **When to Seek Professional Help:** Emphasize the importance of seeking legal and financial advice from qualified professionals (attorneys specializing in family law and QDROs, financial advisors) during the divorce and QDRO process.
9.  **Example Scenario:** Include a brief hypothetical scenario to illustrate how a QDRO works in practice (e.g., John and Jane are divorcing. John has a 401(k) worth $200,000. The QDRO awards Jane 50% of the account balance...).

# Constraints
*   Write in clear, concise, and easy-to-understand language suitable for a general audience with limited legal or financial knowledge. Avoid excessive jargon.
*   Maintain an objective and informative tone throughout the guide.
*   Focus on providing practical and actionable information.
*   The guide should be approximately 1000-1500 words in length.
*   Ensure all information is legally accurate and up-to-date as of the current year.

# Output Format
Markdown document with clear headings and subheadings for each section. Use bullet points or numbered lists where appropriate for clarity. Include the example scenario at the end.
