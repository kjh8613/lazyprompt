## 💡 Pro Tips
1.  **[ ] Placeholders:** While this prompt is designed to be self-contained, if you wanted to add specific examples of trusts or tax codes, you would replace the general mentions with those specifics. For instance, instead of "various types of trusts," you could list "testamentary trusts, grantor retained annuity trusts (GRATs), or qualified personal residence trusts (QPRTs)."
2.  **[ ] Additional Information:** To further tailor the output, you could specify the typical age range of the farmers you're targeting (e.g., "farmers aged 55 and older") or mention any particular regional challenges if relevant to your audience.
3.  **[ ] Recommended Model:** For this complex and nuanced task, a powerful language model is recommended. **GPT-4o**, **Claude 3.5 Sonnet**, or **Gemini 1.5 Pro** would be ideal choices.
