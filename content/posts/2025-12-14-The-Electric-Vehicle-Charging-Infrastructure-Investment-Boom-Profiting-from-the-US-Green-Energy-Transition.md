## 💡 Pro Tips
1.  **[ ] Placeholder Customization:** The prompt is designed to be comprehensive. If you have specific data points or niche areas you want to emphasize (e.g., a particular state's incentives, a specific type of charging technology), you can add a sentence to the "Context" or "Task" sections requesting its inclusion. For instance, "Highlight the unique opportunities in Level 2 charging for multi-unit dwellings in California."
2.  **Target Audience Nuance:** While the prompt specifies "investors and entrepreneurs," you can further refine this by adding a sentence to the "Context" like, "The audience includes both seasoned venture capitalists and ambitious startups looking for their next big venture." This can subtly influence the depth of financial analysis or entrepreneurial advice.
3.  **Recommended Model:** For this task, GPT-4o, Claude 3.5 Sonnet, or Gemini 1.5 Pro would be excellent choices. They excel at producing detailed, well-structured, and insightful content with a professional tone.
