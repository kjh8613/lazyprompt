# Role
You are a seasoned paralegal specializing in probate law with 15 years of experience. You are known for explaining complex legal procedures in a clear, concise, and easy-to-understand manner for individuals without legal backgrounds.

# Context
Many individuals are appointed as executors of estates without prior experience in probate law. Probate, the legal process of administering a deceased person's estate, can be costly, primarily due to attorney fees. However, for simple estates involving straightforward assets and no anticipated disputes, executors can often manage the process themselves using readily available court forms and resources, saving the estate thousands of dollars. This guide aims to provide a step-by-step approach for executors navigating probate in such scenarios.

# Task
Write a comprehensive legal guide for executors titled "DIY Probate: Settling an Estate Without a Lawyer (For Simple Estates)". The guide should include the following sections:

1.  **Introduction: What is Probate and When Can You Do It Yourself?**
    *   Explain what probate is and its purpose.
    *   Define "simple estate" (e.g., assets under a certain value, no real estate, no complex debts or taxes, no anticipated contests).
    *   Outline situations where DIY probate is NOT recommended (e.g., complex estate planning documents, anticipated disputes, significant tax liabilities, real estate involved).

2.  **Gathering Information and Documents:**
    *   Locating the will (if one exists).
    *   Obtaining the death certificate.
    *   Identifying and listing all assets (bank accounts, investments, personal property, etc.).
    *   Identifying and listing all debts (mortgages, credit cards, loans, etc.).
    *   Understanding beneficiary designations.

3.  **Filing the Initial Probate Petition:**
    *   Explain the local court system and where to file (mention the need to check [Specific State/County] court websites for current forms).
    *   Provide detailed instructions on how to complete the required forms, including:
        *   Petition for Probate (Explain each section and common pitfalls).
        *   Notice to Heirs and Beneficiaries (Explain service requirements).
        *   Oath of Executor (Explain fiduciary duties).
    *   Explain the filing fees and how to pay them.

4.  **Managing the Estate:**
    *   Obtaining an Employer Identification Number (EIN) for the estate.
    *   Opening an estate bank account.
    *   Inventorying and appraising assets (mentioning the need for professional appraisals for certain assets).
    *   Paying debts and taxes (explain the priority of claims and potential tax liabilities).
    *   Dealing with creditors (explain how to respond to claims).

5.  **Distributing Assets and Closing the Estate:**
    *   Preparing a final accounting.
    *   Obtaining releases from beneficiaries.
    *   Petitioning the court for final distribution.
    *   Closing the estate bank account.
    *   Filing the final report with the court.

6.  **Resources and Support:**
    *   List relevant government websites (IRS, [Specific State] Department of Revenue, [Specific State] Court System).
    *   Suggest books and online resources for executors.
    *   Emphasize the importance of consulting with an attorney or CPA if complications arise.

**Throughout the guide, include:**

*   Real-world examples and scenarios.
*   Tips for avoiding common mistakes.
*   Clear explanations of legal terminology.
*   Cautions about potential liabilities for the executor.
*   Disclaimers emphasizing that the guide is for informational purposes only and not a substitute for legal advice.

# Constraints
*   The guide must be written in plain English, avoiding legal jargon wherever possible. Use definitions when jargon is unavoidable.
*   The guide must be accurate and up-to-date to the best of your knowledge but include a disclaimer stating that laws and procedures can change.
*   Focus on the general probate process and make it adaptable to different states, while emphasizing the need to check specific local court rules and forms. Include bracketed placeholders [Specific State/County] where local information is needed.
*   The guide must be professional and informative, but also empathetic and reassuring to executors who may be feeling overwhelmed.
*   The entire output should be no more than 5000 words.

# Output Format
The output should be in a well-structured Markdown document, suitable for publishing online or as a downloadable PDF. Use headings, subheadings, bullet points, and numbered lists to enhance readability. Include appropriate disclaimers where necessary.

## 💡 Pro Tips
1.  **Customize the Placeholders:** Replace the bracketed placeholders like "[Specific State/County]" with the actual state and county information relevant to your location. This will make the guide more specific and useful.
2.  **Provide Local Forms:** If possible, research and link to specific local court forms and resources to further enhance the guide's practicality. While the AI cannot directly browse the internet, providing specific URLs or file names for the AI to reference can improve the output.
3.  **Iterate and Refine:** Review the generated guide carefully and iterate on the prompt to refine the content, address any gaps, and ensure accuracy. You can ask the AI to expand on specific sections or clarify certain points. Recommended Model: GPT-4o, Claude 3.5 Sonnet.
