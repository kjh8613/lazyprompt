## 💡 Pro Tips
1.  **Customize Placeholders:** The prompt is designed to be comprehensive. If you have specific data points (e.g., actual energy savings percentages from a known retrofit, or a particular state's tax credit details), you can insert them into the `[ ]` placeholders within the AI's generated text or refine them during a subsequent editing pass.
2.  **Additional Information for Better Results:** To make the case studies more robust, consider providing the AI with brief summaries of real-world successful mill restorations in New England if you have them. Even anonymized details like "a former textile mill in Western Massachusetts converted to artist lofts" can help.
3.  **Recommended Model:** GPT-4o, Claude 3.5 Sonnet, or Gemini Advanced would be ideal for this task due to their strong writing, comprehension, and content generation capabilities.
