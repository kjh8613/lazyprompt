## 💡 Pro Tips
1.  **[Placeholder Customization]:** The prompt is designed to be highly specific, minimizing the need for user placeholders. However, if you have a particular bookbinding technique or historical detail you'd like emphasized, you could add a note within the `# Task` section, e.g., "When discussing unique techniques, ensure to mention [specific technique or historical development]."
2.  **[Keyword Emphasis]:** While the prompt requests natural integration, if you have specific phrases or contexts where you want a keyword to appear, you can add a note in the `# Task` section. For example, "When discussing business models, ensure the phrase 'starting a book restoration business' is used."
3.  **[Model Recommendation]:** For this complex and creative task, I highly recommend using **GPT-4o**, **Claude 3.5 Sonnet**, or **Gemini Advanced**. These models excel at detailed content generation, maintaining a specific tone, and structuring long-form articles effectively.
