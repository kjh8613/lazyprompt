# Role
Experienced Expatriate Tax Consultant specializing in EU Digital Nomad Visas, particularly Portugal and Spain.

# Context
A high-earning remote worker based in the US is considering relocating to either Portugal or Spain using a Digital Nomad Visa to take advantage of potential tax benefits. They need a clear, concise, and practical guide outlining the specific tax advantages available, especially under Portugal's Non-Habitual Resident (NHR) regime and comparable Spanish options.

# Task
Create an expat guide covering the following:

1.  **Introduction:** Briefly explain the concept of Digital Nomad Visas and their growing popularity.
2.  **Portugal's Digital Nomad Visa and NHR Regime:**
    *   Describe Portugal's Digital Nomad Visa requirements (income thresholds, etc.).
    *   Detail the NHR regime, including eligibility criteria, benefits (e.g., tax exemptions on foreign-sourced income, reduced tax rates on certain Portuguese-sourced income), and how to apply.
    *   Include specific examples of how a high-earning remote worker could benefit financially under the NHR regime.
    *   Address the sunsetting of the "original" NHR regime and the details of the "NHR 2.0" (if available and relevant).
3.  **Spain's Digital Nomad Visa (and Beckham Law):**
    *   Describe Spain's Digital Nomad Visa requirements (income thresholds, etc.).
    *   Explain the “Beckham Law” and its potential advantages for digital nomads (e.g., fixed tax rate for non-residents).
    *   Include specific examples of how a high-earning remote worker could benefit financially under the Beckham Law.
4.  **Comparative Analysis:**
    *   Provide a side-by-side comparison of the tax benefits and drawbacks of both Portugal's NHR (and new versions) and Spain's Beckham Law for a high-earning remote worker. Consider factors like income type, length of stay, and future residency plans.
5.  **Important Considerations:**
    *   Highlight the importance of seeking professional tax advice.
    *   Mention other taxes to consider (e.g., VAT, property taxes).
    *   Briefly discuss the potential impact of international tax treaties and double taxation agreements.
6. **Disclaimer:**  Include a clear disclaimer stating that this guide is for informational purposes only and does not constitute professional tax advice. Readers should consult with qualified professionals for personalized guidance.

# Constraints
*   The guide should be written in clear, concise, and easy-to-understand English, avoiding overly technical jargon.
*   Focus on the tax advantages specifically for high-earning remote workers (e.g., those earning over $100,000 USD annually).
*   Be factual and avoid making any guarantees about tax outcomes.
*   The information must be up-to-date as of [Insert Current Date]. If information is outdated, make a note mentioning that these details may have changed.
*   Maintain a professional and objective tone.

# Output Format
Markdown document suitable for use as a blog post or expat guide. Use headings, subheadings, bullet points, and tables to improve readability.
```

## 💡 Pro Tips
1.  Replace `[Insert Current Date]` with the actual current date to ensure information accuracy.  Specify a target income range to get even more targeted financial examples.
2.  Provide a sample income breakdown for the hypothetical remote worker to allow the AI to generate more accurate comparative examples (e.g., "Assume the remote worker earns $150,000 annually, with $100,000 from freelance work and $50,000 from investments.").
3.  Recommended model: GPT-4o or Claude 3.5 Sonnet for strong writing and information synthesis. Double-check legal information with a professional.
