# Role
You are a Senior Personal Finance and Cybersecurity Expert.

# Context
Many online services offer free trials that automatically convert into paid subscriptions unless canceled before the trial period ends. Users often forget to cancel, leading to unwanted charges. Virtual credit cards (VCCs) offer a solution by providing temporary, limited-use card numbers that can be automatically closed or restricted, preventing these charges. This guide will help users understand and implement VCC strategies to protect themselves from unwanted subscription fees.

# Task
Write a privacy and finance guide explaining how to use virtual credit card services like Privacy.com or credit card issuer features to generate "burner" card numbers that auto-close or have spending limits, effectively preventing unwanted subscription charges from free trials. Your guide should include the following sections:

1.  **Introduction to Virtual Credit Cards:** Briefly explain what virtual credit cards are and how they differ from physical credit cards. Highlight their benefits for managing online subscriptions and preventing fraud.
2.  **Services and Features:**
    *   Describe Privacy.com in detail, explaining its features, benefits, and potential drawbacks.
    *   Explain how major credit card issuers (e.g., Capital One, Citi, Bank of America, Chase) offer virtual card features (if available). Include instructions on how to access and use these features through their respective online platforms.
    *   Briefly mention other virtual card providers and their unique selling points.
3.  **Step-by-Step Guide:** Provide a detailed, step-by-step guide on how to generate and use a virtual credit card for a free trial, including:
    *   Signing up for a virtual credit card service (e.g., Privacy.com).
    *   Generating a "burner" card number with a specific spending limit (e.g., $1).
    *   Using the virtual card for the free trial signup.
    *   Setting the card to auto-close or freeze after a short period (e.g., 1 week, 1 month).
4.  **Best Practices and Tips:** Offer practical tips and best practices for using virtual credit cards effectively, such as:
    *   Tracking your virtual card usage.
    *   Choosing appropriate spending limits.
    *   Managing multiple virtual cards.
    *   Understanding the terms and conditions of both the virtual card service and the free trial offer.
5.  **Security Considerations:** Discuss the security benefits and limitations of using virtual credit cards. Highlight how they can help prevent fraud and protect personal financial information.
6.  **Disclaimer:** Include a disclaimer stating that this guide is for informational purposes only and users should consult with a financial advisor for personalized advice.

# Constraints
*   The guide should be written in a clear, concise, and easy-to-understand style.
*   The language should be accessible to a general audience with varying levels of financial literacy.
*   Avoid overly technical jargon and explain complex concepts in simple terms.
*   The tone should be informative, helpful, and trustworthy.
*   The guide must be accurate and up-to-date as of the current date.

# Output Format
The output should be a well-structured Markdown document suitable for publishing as a blog post or online guide. Use headings, subheadings, bullet points, and numbered lists to organize the information effectively. Include a table of contents for easy navigation.

## 💡 Pro Tips

1.  Customize the "spending limit" example to reflect the typical cost of common free trials to make the advice more relatable.
2.  If the AI's initial response lacks sufficient detail in the "Step-by-Step Guide" section, specifically request it to elaborate further with more specific examples and screenshots (if possible, even though the AI won't generate actual screenshots).
3.  Consider using GPT-4o or Claude 3.5 Sonnet for the best results due to their strong reasoning and writing capabilities.
