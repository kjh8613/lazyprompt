# Context
Many individuals find it challenging to eat healthy during the work week due to time constraints. Sunday meal prepping offers a solution, but many people are unsure where to start or lack appealing and simple recipe ideas. This guide aims to provide easy-to-follow meal prep options using common American staples.

# Task
1.  Generate 5 distinct meal prep ideas suitable for a week of lunches and/or dinners. Each idea should:
    *   Feature at least one of the following ingredients: chicken, quinoa, roasted vegetables (specify which veggies).
    *   Be presented as a complete meal or meal component that can be easily assembled.
    *   Include a brief description of the meal, highlighting its nutritional benefits and flavor profile.
    *   Provide a simple list of ingredients required for the recipe.
    *   Outline easy-to-follow preparation instructions, assuming a beginner-level cooking skill.
    *   Estimate the total prep and cook time for each meal.
2.  Organize the 5 meal prep ideas into a single, coherent guide.
3.  Include a brief introduction paragraph emphasizing the benefits of Sunday meal prepping and offering general tips (e.g., proper storage, food safety).
4. Conclude with a short paragraph encouraging readers to try the recipes and adapt them to their own tastes.

# Constraints
1.  The tone should be friendly, encouraging, and informative. Avoid overly technical language.
2.  Focus on healthy and balanced meals. Be mindful of portion sizes and nutritional content.
3.  The recipes should be relatively simple and quick to prepare, with a maximum cook time of 45 minutes per meal.
4.  Assume the user has basic kitchen equipment (oven, stovetop, pots, pans, cutting board, knife).
5.  Avoid highly processed ingredients. Emphasize fresh produce and whole grains.

# Output Format
Markdown format, including:

*   A title: "5 Easy Sunday Meal Prep Ideas for a Healthy Week"
*   A brief introductory paragraph (as per Task #3).
*   Each meal prep idea presented as a separate section with a clear heading (e.g., "Lemon Herb Chicken with Roasted Broccoli and Quinoa").
