## 💡 Pro Tips
1.  **[Password Manager]**: While the prompt mentions "reputable password manager," you can refine this by adding a few examples of well-known ones like LastPass, 1Password, or Bitwarden to the AI's context if you prefer specific mentions, but keep it general for broader appeal.
2.  **[Estate Planning Attorney]**: Emphasize the importance of specifying *which* attorney in the prompt if you have a specific type in mind (e.g., "an estate planning attorney specializing in digital assets"). The current prompt advises consulting with one, which is a good general approach.
3.  **[Recommended model]**: For this sophisticated writing task requiring nuance, technical explanation, and structured output, **GPT-4o**, **Claude 3.5 Sonnet**, or **Gemini Advanced** would be ideal.
