They need a comprehensive comparison of these two business structures, highlighting their key differences, advantages, and disadvantages. The freelancer wants to understand the implications for tax, liability, administration, and overall operational flexibility.

2.  **Formation/Joining Process:** Describe the process of joining an Umbrella Company vs. forming an LLC.
3.  **Taxation:** Detail how income is taxed under each structure, including relevant taxes (e.g., Income Tax, National Insurance Contributions in the UK; Self-Employment Tax, Federal Income Tax in the US). Mention the concept of IR35 in the UK context and how it relates to Umbrella Companies.

## 💡 Pro Tips
1.  You can add specific scenarios like the contractor's estimated income or industry to tailor the comparison.
2.  For better accuracy, you can provide links to official UK and US government resources related to taxation and business structures.
3.  Recommended model: GPT-4o is preferred for its understanding of complex legal and financial concepts, but Claude 3.5 Sonnet can also produce a decent result.
