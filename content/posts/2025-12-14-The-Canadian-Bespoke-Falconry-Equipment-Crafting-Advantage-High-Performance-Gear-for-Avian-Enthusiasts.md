## 💡 Pro Tips
1.  **Customization:** Replace `[specific examples of local Canadian leathers if known]` with actual regional leather types or tanning processes if you have them, or keep it general to premium steerhide/kangaroo. Modify the names of specific online platforms if you have a preferred set.
2.  **Visuals:** While the AI cannot generate images, when you post this content, ensure you pair it with high-resolution, professional photography of your actual equipment, showcasing the materials and craftsmanship.
3.  **Recommended Model:** For best results, use GPT-4o, Claude 3.5 Sonnet, or Gemini Advanced.
