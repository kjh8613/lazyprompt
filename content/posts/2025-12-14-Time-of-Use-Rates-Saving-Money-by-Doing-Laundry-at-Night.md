# Role
Home Energy Efficiency Expert & Writer

# Context
Many utility companies are implementing Time-of-Use (TOU) electricity pricing. Homeowners are often unaware of how these plans work and how to optimize their energy consumption to save money. The goal is to create an easy-to-understand guide that empowers homeowners to take control of their energy bills.

# Task
Write a comprehensive home energy guide explaining Time-of-Use (TOU) electricity pricing and how to save money by shifting energy-intensive chores to off-peak hours. The guide should include the following:

1.  **Introduction to Time-of-Use (TOU) Pricing:** Define TOU pricing and explain why utility companies are using it.  Explain the concepts of on-peak, off-peak, and mid-peak hours (if applicable). Provide examples of typical TOU schedules.
2.  **Understanding Your Energy Usage:** Explain how to identify your biggest energy consumers (e.g., air conditioning, heating, laundry, dishwashing, electric vehicle charging).  Suggest methods for tracking energy consumption (e.g., reviewing utility bills, using energy monitoring devices).
3.  **Strategies for Shifting Energy Use to Off-Peak Hours:**
    *   Laundry: Explain how to use timers and delay settings to run washing machines and dryers during off-peak hours. Provide specific examples of how much money can be saved.
    *   Dishwashing:  Similar instructions as laundry.
    *   Electric Vehicle (EV) Charging: Explain the benefits of charging EVs during off-peak hours and how to set up scheduled charging.
    *   Heating & Cooling:  Strategies for pre-cooling or pre-heating the house during off-peak hours.  Explain how smart thermostats can help.
    *   Other Appliances: Mention other appliances like pool pumps and hot water heaters, and how to optimize their usage.
4.  **Additional Energy-Saving Tips:**  Provide 3-5 additional tips for reducing overall energy consumption (e.g., using LED lighting, sealing air leaks, improving insulation).
5.  **Conclusion:** Summarize the benefits of TOU pricing and encourage readers to adopt energy-saving practices.

# Constraints
*   **Tone:**  Informative, friendly, and encouraging. Avoid technical jargon unless clearly explained.
*   **Length:** The guide should be approximately 700-900 words.
*   **Accuracy:**  Ensure all information is factually correct and up-to-date. Cite sources where necessary (e.g., for specific savings estimates).
*   **Layout:** Use headings, subheadings, bullet points, and short paragraphs to make the guide easy to read and scan.
*   **Avoidance:**  Do not promote specific brands or products. Focus on general principles and strategies.

# Output Format
Markdown format, ready for publishing on a website or blog.

## 💡 Pro Tips
1.  Customize the **Context** section with specific details about the target audience (e.g., homeowners in a specific region or climate) to tailor the guide's recommendations.
2.  Replace the example appliances in the **Task** section with appliances most relevant to your audience. You can also specify the type of utility rates in your region.
3.  Consider using a model like GPT-4o or Claude 3.5 Sonnet for more nuanced and engaging writing.
