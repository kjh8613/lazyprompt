# Role
Fashion and Beauty Expert with 10+ years of experience in color analysis and personal styling, writing for a general audience.

# Context
Many people are unaware of how color affects their appearance. This guide will introduce the concept of Seasonal Color Analysis and help readers determine their personal color palette (Winter, Spring, Summer, or Autumn). The goal is to empower readers to make informed fashion and beauty choices that enhance their natural beauty.

# Task
Write a comprehensive fashion and beauty guide on "Seasonal Color Analysis: Finding Your Palette (Winter, Spring, Summer, Autumn)". The guide should include the following sections:

1.  **Introduction to Seasonal Color Analysis:**
    *   Explain the concept of Seasonal Color Analysis.
    *   Briefly describe the four seasons and their general characteristics (Winter, Spring, Summer, Autumn).
    *   Explain the benefits of understanding your personal color palette.

2.  **Understanding Skin Undertones:**
    *   Explain the difference between skin tone (surface color) and undertone (underlying hue).
    *   Describe the three main undertones: warm, cool, and neutral.
    *   Provide multiple methods for determining skin undertone, including:
        *   **Vein Test:** Explain how to use the color of your veins to determine undertone.
        *   **Jewelry Test:** Explain how gold and silver jewelry look against your skin.
        *   **White Fabric Test:** Explain how different shades of white affect your complexion.
    *   Include clear visual examples (e.g., images of veins, jewelry, and fabric against different skin tones - consider describing these to allow AI to imagine them effectively).

3.  **Detailed Breakdown of Each Season:**
    *   For each season (Winter, Spring, Summer, Autumn):
        *   Describe the characteristics of people who fall into that season (hair color, eye color, skin tone/undertone).
        *   Provide a detailed color palette, including specific color names (e.g., "True Red," "Emerald Green," "Mustard Yellow," "Dusty Rose").
        *   Explain which colors from the palette are best for clothing, makeup (lipstick, eyeshadow, blush), and accessories.
        *   Explain which colors to avoid (and why) for that season.
        *   Include example outfits and makeup looks using the season's color palette.

4.  **Putting it All Together:**
    *   Provide tips on how to use your seasonal color palette when shopping for clothes and makeup.
    *   Explain how to adapt your palette for different occasions (e.g., work, casual, formal).
    *   Encourage experimentation and finding what works best for the individual.

# Constraints
*   The guide should be written in a clear, concise, and engaging style for a general audience. Avoid overly technical jargon.
*   The tone should be friendly, encouraging, and informative.
*   Focus on providing practical advice and actionable tips.
*   Do not provide medical or dermatological advice.
*   The guide should be approximately 1500-2000 words in length.

# Output Format
Markdown document with clear headings, subheadings, bullet points, and (where appropriate) numbered lists. Use bold text for emphasis and key terms. Consider using a table to summarize the color palettes for each season. Include descriptive alt text if the model supports image generation or referencing existing images.
```

## 💡 Pro Tips
1. Customize the color names to be as specific and evocative as possible. For example, instead of just "red," use "cranberry red," "brick red," or "ruby red." This will help the AI generate more accurate and useful color palettes.
2. Provide specific examples of celebrities or public figures who represent each season. This can help the AI (and the reader) visualize the characteristics of each season.
3. Recommended model: GPT-4o or Gemini 1.5 Pro for best image generation and comprehension of color descriptions. For text-only output, Claude 3.5 Sonnet works well.
