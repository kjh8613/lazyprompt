## 💡 Pro Tips
1.  **Customize the Niche:** If you have a specific parent/grandparent in mind, consider briefly mentioning their actual hobbies or personality traits in the "Context" section to help the AI tailor examples.
2.  **Platform Specificity:** If you prefer a stronger emphasis on one platform over another (e.g., more TikTok-centric), you can add a constraint like "Prioritize TikTok content creation tips, with Instagram as a secondary focus."
3.  **Model Recommendation:** For the best quality, detail, and nuanced understanding of ethical considerations, I recommend using advanced large language models like **GPT-4o, Claude 3.5 Sonnet, or Gemini 1.5 Pro**.
