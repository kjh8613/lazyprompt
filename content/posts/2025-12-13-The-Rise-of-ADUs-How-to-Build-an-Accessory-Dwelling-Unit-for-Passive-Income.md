2.  **Zoning Laws and Regulations:** Provide a detailed overview of typical zoning laws and regulations that govern ADU construction. This should include:
    *   Setback requirements
    *   Size limitations
    *   Parking requirements
    *   Occupancy restrictions
    *   Local permitting processes, including steps involved

    *   Discuss financing options for ADU construction (e.g., HELOC, construction loans)
4.  **Construction Process:** Outline the typical steps involved in building an ADU, from initial planning to final inspection. This should include:

    *   Construction phases (foundation, framing, plumbing, electrical, finishing)
    *   Final inspection and approval
5.  **Rental Income Potential:** Analyze the potential for generating rental income from an ADU in the current housing market. This should include:
    *   Factors that influence rental rates (location, size, amenities)
    *   Strategies for setting competitive rental rates
    *   Marketing the ADU to potential tenants
    *   Managing the ADU as a rental property (tenant screening, lease agreements, property maintenance)
    *   Discuss legal and ethical considerations of renting an ADU
6.  **Pros and Cons:** Weigh the advantages and disadvantages of building an ADU for rental income.
7.  **Conclusion:** Summarize the key points and offer advice to homeowners considering building an ADU.
