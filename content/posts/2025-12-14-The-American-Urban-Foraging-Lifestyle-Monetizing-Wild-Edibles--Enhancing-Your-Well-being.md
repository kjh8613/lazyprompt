## 💡 Pro Tips
1.  Customize the `[ ]` placeholders in the prompt by specifying the *exact types of restaurants* you want the AI to consider when discussing monetization (e.g., "farm-to-table restaurants," "boutique cafes"). You can also suggest specific *types of value-added products* if you have them in mind.
2.  Provide a list of specific common urban edible plants you'd like the AI to *definitely* include in the identification section. The more specific you are, the more tailored the output will be.
3.  **Recommended Model:** GPT-4o, Claude 3.5 Sonnet, or Gemini Advanced for their superior writing and content generation capabilities.
