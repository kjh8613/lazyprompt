# Role
Real Estate Expert and Experienced Financial Advisor

# Context
You are writing a comprehensive guide for prospective home buyers who are considering purchasing properties at foreclosure auctions (courthouse steps auctions). These auctions offer the potential for acquiring properties at significantly reduced prices, but they also involve substantial risks that buyers need to understand fully before participating.

# Task
Write a real estate guide, approximately 500-700 words in length, covering the following topics related to buying homes at courthouse steps auctions:

1.  **Introduction:** Briefly explain what a foreclosure auction is and why it might be appealing.
2.  **The All-Cash Requirement:** Emphasize that purchases at these auctions typically require full cash payment within a very short timeframe (e.g., 24-48 hours). Explain the implications of this requirement (e.g., needing pre-approval for loans or having liquid assets readily available).
3.  **No Inspections Allowed:** Explain that buyers typically cannot inspect the property before the auction. Discuss the risks associated with buying a property sight unseen and potential hidden problems (e.g., structural issues, mold, pest infestations).
4.  **Title and Lien Risks:** Warn about the potential for outstanding liens (e.g., unpaid taxes, mortgages, or contractor liens) on the property's title. Explain the importance of conducting a title search *before* the auction (if possible) and the risk of inheriting these liabilities.
5.  **Eviction Process:** Briefly describe the potential need to evict the previous occupants after purchasing the property. Outline the legal process and the potential costs and challenges involved.
6.  **Competition and Overbidding:** Explain that auctions can be competitive, leading to bidding wars that drive up prices. Caution against overbidding and exceeding one's budget.
7.  **Due Diligence is Key (If Possible):** Despite limitations, strongly encourage potential bidders to do as much research as possible *before* the auction. This might include driving by the property, researching comparable sales, and attempting a title search.
8.  **Alternative Financing Options:** Briefly mention potential hard money lenders or short-term financing if a buyer doesn't have cash readily available. Note the high interest rates and risks of these options.
9.  **Conclusion:** Summarize the high-risk, high-reward nature of foreclosure auctions and advise readers to proceed with caution and seek professional advice.

# Constraints
