2.  **Understanding Soundproofing vs. Sound Absorption:** Clearly differentiate between these two concepts in simple terms.
3.  **Affordable Solutions:** Provide detailed instructions for the following soundproofing methods:
    *   **Acoustic Panels (DIY):**
        *   Materials needed (e.g., wood frame, fabric, sound-dampening material like mineral wool or recycled denim).  Include approximate costs.
        *   Step-by-step construction guide with clear instructions (e.g., "Cut the wood to these dimensions...", "Wrap the frame with fabric...").
        *   Mounting suggestions (e.g., using command strips, hanging with picture wire).
    *   **Weather Stripping and Door Sweeps:**
        *   Explain where to apply weather stripping (door and window frames).
        *   Different types of weather stripping (foam, felt, rubber) and their pros/cons.
        *   How to install weather stripping and door sweeps properly.
    *   **Heavy Curtains or Blankets:**
        *   Explain how heavy curtains/blankets absorb sound.
        *   Suggestions for suitable materials (e.g., blackout curtains, thick blankets).
        *   How to hang them effectively to maximize sound absorption.
    *   **Sealing Gaps and Cracks:**
        *   Identify common areas for gaps and cracks (e.g., around windows, pipes, electrical outlets).
        *   Recommend caulk or sealant to fill these gaps.
4.  **Bonus Tips:** Offer 2-3 additional low-cost soundproofing ideas (e.g., rearranging furniture, using a white noise machine, adding rugs).
