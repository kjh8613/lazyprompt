# Context
The New York City rent stabilization system is notoriously intricate and a frequent source of disputes between tenants and landlords. A comprehensive, objective, and actionable guide is urgently needed to help both parties understand their rights and obligations, prevent conflicts, and navigate legal processes effectively. This guide is intended for current and prospective tenants and landlords in NYC seeking to understand and comply with these laws.

# Task

1.  **Introduction:** Briefly explain the purpose and scope of rent stabilization in NYC.
2.  **Understanding Rent Stabilization:**
    *   **Eligibility:** What makes an apartment rent-stabilized? (Building size, construction date, previous deregulation, etc.).
    *   **Key Concepts:** Define "legal regulated rent," "preferential rent," and the role of the Rent Guidelines Board (RGB).
3.  **Tenant Rights & Protections:**
    *   **Lease Renewals:** Automatic right to renewal, notice requirements.
    *   **Lawful Rent Increases:** How increases are determined (RGB guidelines), limitations.

    *   **Right to Organize:** Tenant association rights.
4.  **Landlord Obligations & Permitted Actions:**
    *   **Record Keeping:** Importance of accurate rent histories and documentation.
    *   **Rent Increases:** Adhering to RGB guidelines, individual apartment improvements (IAIs), major capital improvements (MCIs) – detailing criteria and processes for each.
    *   **Lease Provisions:** What landlords can and cannot include in leases.
    *   **Notice Requirements:** For lease renewals, rent increases, access for repairs.
5.  **Common Disputes and How to Navigate Them Legally:**
    *   **Rent Overcharges:**
        *   Tenant perspective: How to check for overcharges, evidence gathering, filing a DHCR complaint.
        *   Landlord perspective: Defending against overcharge claims, statute of limitations, importance of rent history.
        *   *Example scenario:* Tenant suspects rent is too high after previous tenant paid less.
    *   **Repairs & Essential Services:**
        *   Tenant perspective: Documenting conditions, requesting repairs, withholding rent (with caveats), HPD complaints, HP actions.
        *   Landlord perspective: Timely repairs, avoiding harassment claims, notice to enter.
        *   *Example scenario:* Landlord fails to fix a persistent leak causing damage.
    *   **Succession Rights:**
        *   Tenant perspective: Eligibility criteria (family relationship, primary residence), required documentation, asserting rights.

    *   **Lease Non-Renewals & Evictions:**

        *   Landlord perspective: Permissible reasons for non-renewal (e.g., owner occupancy, demolition), proper notice.

6.  **Actionable Tips:**

        *   Know your rights and status.
        *   Document EVERYTHING (leases, rent receipts, repair requests, communication).
        *   Understand your lease.
        *   Utilize official resources (DHCR, HPD, Housing Court).
        *   Seek legal counsel when needed.
    *   **For Landlords:**

# Constraints

3.  **Structure:** Use clear headings, subheadings, bullet points, and numbered lists to enhance readability and organization.
4.  **Integration of Citations:** Citations to the NYC Rent Stabilization Code (e.g., "9 NYCRR § 2523.5") must be woven naturally into the text where specific rules are discussed, not just listed at the end.

## 💡 Pro Tips
1.  **Verify URLs:** When the AI generates the "Official NYC Government Resources" section, remember that AI models cannot browse live websites. The names of the agencies and types of resources will be accurate, but you'll need to manually search for the most current URLs.
2.  **Check for Updates:** Housing laws, especially in NYC, can change frequently. Always cross-reference the information with the most current official resources or a legal professional, particularly if the AI's training data has an older cutoff.
3.  **Recommended Model:** For the best and most comprehensive legal-style output, use advanced models like **GPT-4o, Claude 3.5 Sonnet, or Gemini Advanced**.
