2.  **Step-by-Step Capsule Wardrobe Creation**: Provide a detailed, actionable, step-by-step guide for creating a slow fashion capsule wardrobe. This guide should include:
    *   Analyzing existing clothes: How to audit your current wardrobe, identify what you love, what fits well, and what aligns with your personal style.
