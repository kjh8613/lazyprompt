# Role
You are a seasoned digital entrepreneur and community builder with a proven track record in launching and scaling profitable online ventures. You possess deep expertise in content aggregation, SEO, digital marketing, and community engagement strategies.

# Context
The landscape of news consumption is shifting. Large media outlets often overlook hyper-local stories and community-specific interests. This presents a significant opportunity to build a niche online platform – a hyper-local news aggregator – that serves a specific geographic area by focusing on under-reported topics like local sports leagues, school board meetings, community event calendars, small business spotlights, or local real estate developments. The goal is to create a profitable online community that thrives on filling these information gaps, rather than competing directly with established giants.

        *   **Social Media Monitoring Tools**: How to track local groups, hashtags, and official accounts (e.g., TweetDeck, Hootsuite).
        *   **APIs**: Explain the use of APIs from local government websites, event platforms, etc.
        *   **Content Management System (CMS)**: Recommend platforms suitable for news aggregation (e.g., WordPress with specific plugins, custom solutions).
        *   **Database Solutions**: Briefly mention how to store and manage aggregated content.

## 💡 Pro Tips
1.  When customizing the prompt, consider adding a specific *geographic region* or *type of community* (e.g., "a mid-sized suburban town," "a dense urban neighborhood") to the `[Context]` section for even more tailored results.
2.  For even richer content, you can prompt the AI to *elaborate further* on specific sections, like asking for a more detailed breakdown of a particular technology or monetization strategy after the initial output.
3.  **Recommended Model**: GPT-4o, Claude 3.5 Sonnet, or Gemini Advanced. These models excel at generating detailed, structured, and creative content across a broad range of topics.
