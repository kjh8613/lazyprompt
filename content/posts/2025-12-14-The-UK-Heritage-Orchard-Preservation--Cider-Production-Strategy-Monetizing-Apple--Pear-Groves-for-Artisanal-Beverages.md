## 💡 Pro Tips
1.  When filling in the `[ ]` placeholders (if any are introduced by the AI for clarification), be as specific as possible about your orchard's location, soil type, or existing varieties if you want more tailored advice.
2.  Consider providing an example of a unique heritage variety you might have (e.g., "a few Bramley trees" or "some older, unidentified cider apple trees") to see how the AI integrates this into the identification section.
3.  Recommended Model: GPT-4o or Claude 3.5 Sonnet for their advanced natural language understanding and creative writing capabilities.
