# Role
Expert Tax Advisor specializing in US expat taxation and IRS regulations.

# Context
Many American digital nomads and expats are unaware of the Foreign Earned Income Exclusion (FEIE) and its potential to significantly reduce or eliminate their US income tax liability. They need a clear and concise guide explaining the FEIE, its requirements, and how to claim it. Assume the reader has a basic understanding of US income tax but limited knowledge of expat-specific rules.

# Task
Write a comprehensive tax guide for digital nomads and expats explaining the Foreign Earned Income Exclusion (FEIE). The guide should include the following sections:

1.  **Introduction to the FEIE:** Briefly explain what the FEIE is, its purpose, and the maximum exclusion amount (currently around $120,000 - mention it's subject to change annually).
2.  **Eligibility Requirements:** Clearly outline the two main requirements to qualify for the FEIE:
    *   **Tax Home Test:** Explain what a "tax home" is and how to determine if your tax home is in a foreign country. Give examples.
    *   **Bona Fide Residence Test or Physical Presence Test:** Explain both tests in detail, emphasizing the Physical Presence Test.
3.  **The Physical Presence Test:**
    *   Describe the Physical Presence Test requirements: 330 full days outside the US during any consecutive 12-month period.
    *   Explain what constitutes a "full day" and how to calculate the 330 days.
    *   Provide examples of situations that meet and do not meet the Physical Presence Test.  Specifically address common scenarios for digital nomads, such as short trips back to the US for family visits or brief travel to other countries.
    *   Address potential exceptions to the 330-day rule.
4.  **IRS Form 2555:**
    *   Explain the purpose of Form 2555 and when it needs to be filed.
    *   Walk through the basic steps of completing Form 2555, highlighting key sections. Provide a brief overview of the different parts of the form and what information is needed.
    *   Mention the importance of accurate record-keeping of travel dates and locations.
5.  **Calculating the FEIE:** Explain how to calculate the amount of foreign earned income that can be excluded.
6.  **Interaction with Other Tax Benefits:** Briefly touch on how the FEIE interacts with other tax benefits, such as the Foreign Tax Credit (FTC). Note that claiming the FEIE might affect eligibility for certain credits or deductions.
7.  **Important Considerations and Disclaimer:** Include a disclaimer stating that this is for informational purposes only and not financial advice, and that readers should consult with a qualified tax professional.

# Constraints
*   Write in clear, concise, and easy-to-understand language. Avoid overly technical jargon.
*   Maintain a professional and informative tone.
*   The guide should be accurate and up-to-date as of the current tax year (mention the tax year where applicable).
*   Do not provide specific financial or tax advice.
*   Structure the guide with clear headings and subheadings for easy readability.

# Output Format
Markdown document.
