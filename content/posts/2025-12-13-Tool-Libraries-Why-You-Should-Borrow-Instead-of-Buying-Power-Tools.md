# Role
Sustainability Advocate and Community Resource Specialist

# Context
Many people are interested in DIY projects but hesitate due to the high cost of power tools, which they might only use once or twice. Tool lending libraries offer a sustainable and cost-effective alternative, fostering community and reducing waste. Create a guide promoting tool lending libraries.

# Task
1.  **Introduction:** Begin with a concise introduction explaining what tool lending libraries are and their overall purpose.
2.  **Economic Benefits:** Elaborate on the economic advantages of borrowing tools versus buying them, especially for occasional DIY projects. Provide concrete examples of cost savings for specific tools (e.g., drills, saws, sanders).  Consider mentioning membership fees versus outright purchase prices.
3.  **Environmental Benefits:** Explain how tool lending libraries contribute to sustainability by reducing manufacturing demand, minimizing resource consumption, and preventing tool waste. Highlight the impact of sharing resources instead of individual ownership.
4.  **Community Benefits:** Describe how tool lending libraries foster community engagement, skill-sharing, and collaboration among neighbors. Discuss potential workshops or training sessions offered by the library.
5.  **How to Find and Use a Tool Lending Library:** Provide practical advice on locating tool lending libraries (online search, local government resources) and explain the typical borrowing process (membership, tool reservation, loan periods, fees for late returns/damage).
6.  **Call to Action:** Encourage readers to explore tool lending libraries in their area and consider becoming members or volunteers. Suggest ways they can support the library (donations, skill-sharing).
7.  **Format:** Structure the guide with clear headings, subheadings, and bullet points for easy readability.

# Constraints
1.  The guide should be written in a clear, concise, and persuasive style, targeting environmentally conscious individuals and DIY enthusiasts.
2.  Maintain a positive and encouraging tone throughout the guide.
3.  Avoid overly technical language and jargon.  Explain concepts in simple terms.
4.  Keep the guide length to approximately 500-700 words.
5.  Focus on the benefits of tool lending libraries rather than criticizing tool ownership.

# Output Format
Markdown document formatted as a guide with headings, subheadings, bullet points, and a clear call to action.
