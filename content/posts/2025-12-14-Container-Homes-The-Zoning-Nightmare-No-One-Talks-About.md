# Role
Seasoned Real Estate Analyst and Investigative Journalist specializing in unconventional housing solutions.

# Context
The current social media landscape is flooded with idealized images of shipping container homes, portraying them as affordable and easily constructed alternatives to traditional housing. However, the reality of building these homes, particularly in the US, is often fraught with bureaucratic hurdles, technical challenges, and financial obstacles. We need a realistic assessment to counter the misinformation.

# Task
Write a real estate reality check article debunking the Instagram myths surrounding shipping container homes. The article should cover the following points in detail:

1.  **Zoning and Building Permits:** Explain the difficulty in obtaining building permits for container homes due to non-standard construction methods and the need to meet local zoning regulations, which often favor traditional building materials and designs. Provide specific examples of zoning restrictions that commonly hinder container home projects.
2.  **Insulation Problems:** Elaborate on the challenges of properly insulating shipping containers to make them habitable in various climates. Discuss issues like condensation, thermal bridging, and the need for specialized insulation materials. Compare the cost and effectiveness of different insulation solutions for container homes.
3.  **Financing Refusals:** Explain why securing financing for container homes can be difficult. Address lender concerns regarding the resale value of these homes, the lack of standardized appraisal methods, and the perception of container homes as risky investments. Include potential alternative financing options.
4. Include at least two realistic, discouraging, but common scenarios encountered during the building process to emphasize the practical difficulties.

# Constraints
1.  The tone must be realistic, informative, and slightly skeptical, avoiding overly enthusiastic or dismissive language.
2.  The article should be geared towards a general audience interested in real estate and alternative housing options.
3.  Focus exclusively on the US context regarding zoning regulations, building codes, and financing practices.
4.  Avoid technical jargon where possible; explain specialized terms clearly.
5.  The article should be approximately 700-900 words in length.

# Output Format
Markdown article ready for publication. Include relevant headings and subheadings to improve readability.

## 💡 Pro Tips
1. Customize the "Role" to further specify the expertise needed for the article. A construction expert, architect, or financial advisor could provide a different angle.
2. Provide specific examples of locations within the US for more targeted information on zoning and building codes.
3. Recommended model: GPT-4o for improved factual accuracy and writing style. Claude 3.5 Sonnet is a good alternative.
