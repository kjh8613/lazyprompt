# Role
Financial Advisor & Personal Finance Blogger with 10+ years of experience, known for simplifying complex financial topics and providing actionable advice.

# Context
You are writing a blog post for an audience of young professionals and experienced investors who are looking for tax-advantaged ways to save for retirement. They may already be familiar with traditional retirement accounts like 401(k)s and IRAs, but are less knowledgeable about the benefits of Health Savings Accounts (HSAs) as retirement savings vehicles.

# Task
Write a blog post titled "The 'Triple Tax' Advantage: Using an HSA as a Stealth Retirement Fund" that accomplishes the following:

1.  **Introduction:** Briefly explain what an HSA is and who is eligible to contribute.
2.  **The Triple Tax Advantage:** Clearly and concisely explain the three tax advantages offered by HSAs (tax-deductible contributions, tax-free growth, and tax-free withdrawals for qualified medical expenses).
3.  **HSA as a Retirement Fund:** Explain why savvy investors treat HSAs as a "stealth" retirement fund. Emphasize the benefits of paying for current medical expenses out-of-pocket and allowing the HSA to grow over time.
4.  **Investment Options:** Briefly mention the investment options typically available within an HSA (e.g., stocks, bonds, mutual funds).
5.  **Withdrawal Strategies:** Explain the options for withdrawing funds from an HSA in retirement, including using the funds for medical expenses or treating it as a traditional IRA after age 65.
6.  **Potential Drawbacks:** Briefly mention any potential drawbacks or risks associated with using an HSA as a retirement fund.
7.  **Conclusion:** Summarize the key benefits of using an HSA as a retirement savings tool and encourage readers to consider incorporating it into their financial plan.

# Constraints
1.  Maintain a clear, concise, and engaging writing style, avoiding overly technical jargon.
2.  The blog post should be approximately 700-900 words in length.
3.  The tone should be informative and encouraging, highlighting the potential benefits while acknowledging potential risks.
4.  Include real-world examples or scenarios to illustrate key points.
5.  Do not provide financial advice specific to any individual. The information should be general in nature.

# Output Format
Markdown

## 💡 Pro Tips
1.  **[Tailor the audience]:** Modify the Context section to target a more specific demographic (e.g., self-employed individuals, high-income earners) to further refine the post's relevance.
2.  **[Expand on Drawbacks]:** If you want a more balanced perspective, add a Task item that explicitly asks for a detailed exploration of the disadvantages. For example, "Discuss the potential downsides such as contribution limits, eligibility requirements, and the risk of needing the funds for unexpected medical expenses before retirement."
3.  **[Recommended Model]:** GPT-4o or Claude 3.5 Opus will likely yield the highest quality and most nuanced blog post due to their superior understanding of financial concepts and writing abilities.
