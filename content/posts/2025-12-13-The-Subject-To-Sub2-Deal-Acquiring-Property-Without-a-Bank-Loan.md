2.  **Benefits for the Buyer:** Detail at least five key advantages for the buyer. Include benefits like lower upfront costs, faster closing times, potential for positive cash flow, ability to acquire properties with existing below-market interest rates, and circumventing strict lending requirements.

4.  **Risks for the Buyer:** Clearly outline at least five potential risks associated with "Subject To" deals. Include the "due-on-sale" clause risk, the seller's potential mismanagement of mortgage payments, potential liens on the property, difficulty obtaining homeowner's insurance, and the legal complexities involved.
5.  **Risks for the Seller:** Clearly outline at least five potential risks associated with "Subject To" deals. Include damage to credit score if the buyer defaults, the mortgage still being in the seller's name, potential for legal repercussions if the buyer violates the terms of the original mortgage, difficulty securing future loans, and emotional distress from relinquishing control.
6.  **Due Diligence Checklist:** Create a checklist of at least ten crucial steps a buyer should take before entering a "Subject To" agreement. This should include title searches, property inspections, reviewing mortgage documents, verifying insurance coverage, understanding the seller's financial situation, and consulting with legal and financial professionals.

Cover topics such as negotiating terms, using appropriate legal documentation (contracts, disclosures), setting up escrow accounts for mortgage payments, and establishing clear communication protocols between buyer and seller.
