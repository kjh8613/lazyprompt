# Role
Automotive Legal Expert & Technical Writer with 15+ years of experience specializing in vehicle titling and registration issues, particularly bonded titles.

# Context
An individual has acquired a vehicle (either through a private sale, auction, or finding a neglected vehicle) that lacks a title. They need to legally register the vehicle for road use but are unable to obtain a standard title due to the missing paperwork. They require a comprehensive guide explaining the "Bonded Title" process (also sometimes called a "Surety Bond Title" or "Certificate of Title Surety Bond"). This guide must be state-agnostic initially, outlining general principles, while also providing a framework for the user to research specific state requirements.

# Task
1.  **Introduction:** Begin with a brief overview of why a vehicle might lack a title and why a bonded title is necessary. Clearly define what a "Bonded Title" is and its purpose.
2.  **Eligibility:** Describe the general eligibility requirements for obtaining a bonded title (e.g., residency, vehicle inspection, etc.). Note common reasons why someone *would not* be eligible.
3.  **Step-by-Step Process:** Outline the process of obtaining a bonded title in a numbered, step-by-step format. This should include:
    *   **Vehicle Inspection:** Explain the need for a vehicle inspection to verify the VIN and condition.
    *   **Title Search:** Detail how to conduct a title search (or have one conducted) to identify any existing liens or ownership claims. Explain the importance of a clean title search.
    *   **Vehicle Appraisal:** Explain why a vehicle appraisal is needed and how it determines the bond amount. Provide examples of acceptable appraisal methods.
    *   **Surety Bond Acquisition:** Explain what a surety bond is, how the bond amount is calculated (usually 1-2x the vehicle's appraised value), how to obtain a surety bond from a licensed surety company, and the associated costs.
    *   **Application Submission:** Describe the required documentation to submit to the state's Department of Motor Vehicles (DMV) or equivalent agency, including the application form, inspection report, title search results, vehicle appraisal, and surety bond.
    *   **Waiting Period:** Explain the typical waiting period (e.g., 3-5 years) before the bonded title converts to a clear title.
4.  **Bond Claims:** Explain what happens if someone makes a claim against the bond during the waiting period. Explain the claimant's rights and the bondholder's responsibilities.
5.  **Converting to a Clear Title:** Describe the process of converting the bonded title to a clear title after the waiting period expires, assuming no claims have been filed.
6.  **State-Specific Research:** Provide guidance on how the user can research the specific bonded title requirements in their state, including recommended resources (e.g., state DMV websites, legal aid resources). Include a caution that regulations can vary significantly by state.
7.  **Disclaimer:** Include a clear disclaimer stating that this guide is for informational purposes only and does not constitute legal advice. Advise readers to consult with a qualified legal professional or their state's DMV for accurate and up-to-date information.

# Constraints
*   The guide must be written in clear, concise, and easy-to-understand language, avoiding overly technical jargon.
*   The tone should be informative and helpful, providing practical advice to the reader.
*   The guide must not provide legal advice; instead, it should provide information on the general process and encourage readers to consult with legal professionals or their state's DMV.
*   The guide must be accurate and up-to-date based on general knowledge of bonded title processes across the US.
*   The guide should be formatted for readability and ease of navigation (e.g., using headings, subheadings, and bullet points).

# Output Format
Markdown document suitable for online publication. Use appropriate headings (H1, H2, H3) and lists (numbered and bulleted) for clarity.

## 💡 Pro Tips
1.  **Customization:** Tailor the "Context" section to your specific situation. For example, specify the type of vehicle (car, motorcycle, trailer) or the state you are in for more relevant results.
2.  **Specificity:** If you know specific information about your vehicle (e.g., VIN, approximate year), include it in the "Context" section. This can help the AI generate more accurate and targeted information.
3.  **Model Recommendation:** GPT-4o or Claude 3.5 Sonnet are recommended for their ability to generate detailed and well-structured legal content. Review and verify the information provided, especially regarding state-specific laws.
