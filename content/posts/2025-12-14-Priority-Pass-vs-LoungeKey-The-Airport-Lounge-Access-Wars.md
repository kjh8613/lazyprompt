# Role
Act as an experienced Luxury Travel Analyst with a deep understanding of premium travel benefits, loyalty programs, and the nuances of airport lounge access.

# Context
I am a discerning traveler who holds premium credit cards offering access to either Priority Pass or LoungeKey lounges. I need to understand which network provides superior value and a more consistent luxury experience. My research should consider the current landscape of airport lounge access, including emerging issues like overcrowding. I'm particularly interested in how these networks compare in terms of their global reach, the quality of their affiliated lounges, their guest policies, and how effectively they address the challenge of overcrowding.

# Task
Conduct a detailed luxury travel comparison between Priority Pass and LoungeKey. Your analysis should cover the following key areas:

1.  **Global Coverage & Network Size:** Compare the number of lounges and their geographical distribution.
2.  **Lounge Quality & Amenities:** Discuss the typical quality of lounges within each network, focusing on aspects relevant to luxury travelers (e.g., dining, seating comfort, quiet zones, Wi-Fi, shower facilities, premium beverages).
3.  **Guest Policies:** Clearly outline the guest policies for each network (e.g., number of guests allowed, fees, specific card limitations).
4.  **Overcrowding Issues & Solutions:** Address the recent trend of overcrowding in airport lounges, discuss how Priority Pass and LoungeKey are affected, and what strategies, if any, they are employing to mitigate these issues.
5.  **Unique Benefits & Differentiators:** Identify any unique perks or services offered by one network that the other lacks.
6.  **Overall Value Proposition for Luxury Travelers:** Conclude with an overall assessment of which network currently offers a better luxury airport lounge experience and why.

# Constraints
1.  **Tone:** Maintain a sophisticated, objective, and informative tone suitable for a luxury travel audience.
2.  **Focus:** Emphasize aspects that contribute to a luxury travel experience. Avoid overly technical jargon.
3.  **Data Currency:** Ensure the information reflects the current state of lounge access, including recent trends and any known significant changes.
4.  **Structure:** Present the comparison logically, using clear headings for each comparison point.
5.  **Prohibitions:** Do not recommend specific credit cards; focus solely on the lounge networks themselves.

# Output Format
Present the comparison as a well-structured Markdown document with clear headings and bullet points for each section. A comparative table summarizing key differences (Coverage, Guest Policy, Overcrowding Impact, Luxury Experience Score) would be beneficial as part of the output.

## 💡 Pro Tips
1.  For the "[ ] placeholders" (though none are explicitly present in this highly specific prompt), you would typically insert information relevant to your personal situation, such as "I often fly out of [specific major airports]" or "My priority is [dining/quiet spaces]." However, this prompt is designed to be self-contained.
2.  To further refine the "Luxury Experience Score," you could add a sentence in the Context like, "I am willing to pay a small fee for a guest if the lounge experience justifies it." This would guide the AI to consider fee structures in its value assessment.
3.  **Recommended Model:** GPT-4o, Claude 3.5 Sonnet, or Gemini Advanced are recommended for their advanced analytical and writing capabilities.
