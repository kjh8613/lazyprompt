# Role
Travel Expert and Guide Writer specializing in flight hacking and itinerary optimization.

# Context
You are creating a comprehensive travel guide for readers looking to maximize their travel experience and see more cities without wasting time or money on unnecessary backtracking. The guide will focus on "Open Jaw" flights as a strategic method to achieve this. Assume the audience is familiar with basic flight booking procedures but may be unaware of the benefits and nuances of Open Jaw itineraries.

# Task
1.  **Define Open Jaw Flights:** Clearly explain what an "Open Jaw" flight itinerary is, using a simple and easy-to-understand definition. Include examples like: flying *into* London (LHR) and flying *out* of Paris (CDG).
2.  **Explain the Benefits:** Elaborate on the key advantages of Open Jaw flights, focusing on time and cost savings. Quantify the time and cost savings by contrasting it with traditional round-trip flights that require returning to the original arrival city and using trains/additional flights for inter-city travel. Example: Instead of flying round-trip to Rome and then taking a train to Florence and back, an open jaw flight lets you fly into Rome and out of Florence, saving travel time and train fare. Include another example involving three cities and an internal flight vs. open jaw.
3.  **Provide Booking Tips:** Offer practical advice on how to effectively search for and book Open Jaw flights. This includes:
    *   Which search engines or booking platforms are best suited for finding Open Jaw itineraries (e.g., multi-city search options).
    *   The terminology used by airlines and booking platforms (e.g., "multi-city," "advanced search").
    *   How to use filters and advanced options to specify desired arrival and departure cities.
    *   Suggest setting up price alerts for the desired itinerary.
4.  **Discuss Considerations:** Outline potential drawbacks or things to be aware of when booking Open Jaw flights, such as:
    *   Slightly higher fares compared to round-trip flights in some cases.
    *   The need to arrange transportation between the arrival and departure cities.
    *   Visa requirements if the arrival and departure cities are in different countries.
5.  **Create an Example Itinerary:** Provide a concrete example of an Open Jaw itinerary with specific cities, dates, and estimated costs to illustrate the concept and its benefits. For example, "Fly into Amsterdam on October 20th, take a train to Brussels, and fly out of Brussels on October 27th."
6.  **End with a Call to Action:** Encourage readers to explore Open Jaw flights for their next multi-city trip and highlight the potential for a more efficient and enjoyable travel experience.

# Constraints
*   The guide should be written in a clear, concise, and engaging tone.
*   Avoid using overly technical jargon.
*   Focus on practical tips and actionable advice.
*   The guide should be no more than 700 words.
*   Use appropriate subheadings to break up the text and improve readability.

# Output Format
Markdown document structured as a travel guide with the following sections:

*   **Title:** "Open Jaw Flights: The Travel Hack for Seeing More Cities"
*   **Introduction:** A brief overview of Open Jaw flights and their benefits.

## 💡 Pro Tips
1.  Customize the `Example Itinerary` with specific cities and dates relevant to your target audience. If you know which regions they're interested in (e.g., Europe, Southeast Asia), tailor the example accordingly.
2.  Research current flight booking platforms to ensure the "Booking Tips" section provides accurate and up-to-date information. Specify which websites or search engines are particularly strong for multi-city flight searches.
3.  Consider specifying the ideal model (e.g., GPT-4o) or plugin to use if you have a preference. This ensures the AI has the necessary capabilities to generate high-quality content.
