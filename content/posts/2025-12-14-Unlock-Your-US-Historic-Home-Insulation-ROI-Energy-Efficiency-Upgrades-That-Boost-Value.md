# Role
You are a highly experienced content writer specializing in real estate, home improvement, and historic preservation for a leading online publication targeting US homeowners. Your expertise lies in translating technical information into engaging, benefit-driven content that resonates with a specific audience.

# Context
Historic homes in the United States often present unique insulation challenges and opportunities. Many homeowners are unaware of the significant financial benefits – both in terms of reduced utility costs and increased property value – that come from upgrading their home's insulation. They may also be concerned about preserving the historic integrity of their property during renovations. This blog post needs to address these concerns, provide actionable advice, and encourage investment in energy efficiency upgrades. The target audience is US homeowners who own historic properties and are interested in maximizing their investment and comfort.

# Task
Write a comprehensive and persuasive blog post titled "Unlock Your 'US Historic Home Insulation' ROI: Energy Efficiency Upgrades That Boost Value." The post should:
1.  **Introduce the Problem & Opportunity:** Briefly discuss the challenges of insulating historic homes and highlight the significant economic advantages of doing so.
2.  **Explain Economic Benefits:**
    *   **Increased Property Value:** Detail how improved energy efficiency, often a key selling point, directly correlates with higher market value.
    *   **Reduced Utility Costs:** Quantify or explain the impact of better insulation on heating and cooling bills.
3.  **Actionable Tips for Homeowners:**
    *   **Identifying Common Insulation Issues:** Guide readers on what to look for (drafts, cold spots, visible damage, outdated materials) in older homes.
    *   **Understanding Insulation Materials for Historic Homes:** Discuss suitable materials like cellulose, mineral wool, and potentially carefully applied spray foam (with caveats for historic integrity). Explain their pros and cons in the context of historic preservation.
    *   **Finding Qualified Contractors:** Provide advice on how to locate contractors with specific experience in historic renovations and energy efficiency upgrades. Emphasize checking credentials, portfolios, and references.
4.  **Financial Incentives:**
    *   **Tax Credits & Rebates:** Dedicate a section to researching and mentioning potential federal, state, and local tax credits, rebates, or incentives available for energy efficiency upgrades, particularly those applicable to historic properties. (Note: Instruct the AI to suggest *where* users can find this information rather than listing specific, potentially outdated programs).
5.  **Conclusion:** Summarize the key benefits and encourage homeowners to invest in their historic property's future through insulation upgrades.

# Constraints
1.  **Tone:** Informative, persuasive, optimistic, and authoritative. Avoid overly technical jargon unless explained.
2.  **Audience Focus:** Consistently address US homeowners of historic properties and their specific concerns and potential benefits.
3.  **Actionability:** Provide clear, practical advice that homeowners can implement or use to guide their decisions.
4.  **Historic Preservation Emphasis:** Ensure the discussion on insulation materials and methods respects the need to maintain the historic character of properties.
5.  **SEO Elements:** Naturally incorporate keywords like "historic home insulation," "energy efficiency upgrades," "property value," "utility costs," "tax credits," and "historic renovation."
6.  **Length:** Approximately 1000-1500 words.
7.  **No specific program details:** Do not list exact tax credit amounts or specific rebate programs, as these change frequently. Instead, advise readers on *how and where* to find current information (e.g., ENERGY STAR, DSIRE database, state energy offices).

# Output Format
A well-structured blog post in Markdown format, including:
*   A compelling title.
*   Introduction.
*   Clearly defined sections with subheadings.
*   Bullet points for lists of tips or benefits.
*   A concluding paragraph.
```

## 💡 Pro Tips
1.  When customizing the prompt, **replace `[ ]` placeholders with specific details** if you have them, such as a particular geographic region you want to focus on, or if you want to highlight a specific type of historic home common in your area (e.g., Victorian, Colonial).
2.  For even better results, **provide the AI with links to reputable sources** you want it to reference for information on tax credits and rebates (e.g., the official ENERGY STAR website for federal programs, or the DSIRE database for state-level incentives). You could add this to the "Context" or "Task" section.
3.  **Recommended Model:** GPT-4o or Claude 3.5 Sonnet are excellent choices for this task due to their strong writing capabilities and ability to handle nuanced instructions.
