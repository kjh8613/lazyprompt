# Role
Automotive Technical Writer & DIY Expert

# Context
A growing number of car owners are seeking cost-effective alternatives to dealership services, particularly for tasks like key fob replacement and programming. They are turning to online resources and DIY solutions. Create a detailed, easy-to-follow guide for programming car key fobs at home using readily available tools and parts.

# Task
Write a step-by-step guide titled "DIY Car Key Programming: Saving $300 on a Key Fob." The guide should cover the following:

1.  **Introduction:** Briefly explain the increasing cost of dealership key fob programming and the benefits of DIY alternatives. Highlight potential cost savings.
2.  **Disclaimer:** Include a prominent disclaimer stating that this guide is for informational purposes only and that users are responsible for verifying compatibility and following safety precautions. Emphasize that attempting this procedure incorrectly could damage the vehicle's immobilizer system and that professional assistance may be required in certain cases.
3.  **Required Tools and Materials:** List the necessary tools and materials:
    *   Blank key fob (specify how to find the correct model for their car - year, make, model). Explain where to buy blank key fobs on Amazon (include tips on identifying reputable sellers and avoiding scams). Include warnings about counterfeit fobs.
    *   OBD2 programmer (specifically mention Tom's Key Company as an example, but also suggest researching other reputable brands). Explain the features to look for in a programmer (e.g., car compatibility, ease of use, customer support).
    *   Laptop or smartphone (if required by the OBD2 programmer).
    *   Vehicle's owner's manual.
4.  **Step-by-Step Programming Instructions:** Provide detailed, numbered instructions on how to program the key fob using the OBD2 programmer. This should include:
    *   Connecting the OBD2 programmer to the vehicle's OBD2 port.
    *   Turning on the vehicle's ignition (without starting the engine).
    *   Following the on-screen instructions provided by the OBD2 programmer.
    *   Any specific button presses or sequences required to program the fob.
    *   Testing the programmed key fob to ensure it works correctly (locking/unlocking doors, starting the engine).
5.  **Troubleshooting Tips:** List common problems encountered during the programming process and provide solutions (e.g., programmer not recognizing the key fob, key fob not starting the engine). Include information on when professional assistance may be needed.
6.  **Security Considerations:** Discuss security concerns related to programming car keys (e.g., preventing unauthorized access to the vehicle). Advise users to keep their key fobs secure and to erase old key fobs from the vehicle's system if they are lost or stolen.
7.  **Conclusion:** Summarize the benefits of DIY key fob programming and encourage readers to proceed with caution and research thoroughly before attempting the procedure.

# Constraints
*   The guide must be written in a clear, concise, and easy-to-understand style, suitable for readers with limited technical knowledge.
*   Maintain a neutral and objective tone. Avoid making overly promotional claims about specific products or brands.
*   Emphasize safety precautions and potential risks throughout the guide.
*   Include visual aids (e.g., diagrams, screenshots) where appropriate (note that you will describe the content, and I will provide the visual aids separately).
*   The guide should be approximately 800-1200 words in length.

# Output Format
Markdown document.

## 💡 Pro Tips
1.  Within the [ ] placeholders, provide specific details related to your car's year, make, and model for even more tailored instructions. For example, "[OBD2 port location for a 2018 Honda Civic]" or "[Specific key fob model number for a 2015 Ford F-150]".
2.  If you've already researched a specific OBD2 programmer or have a particular issue you want to be addressed in the troubleshooting section, provide that information to the AI. E.g., "Address common issues with the Autel MaxiIM IM608 programmer."
3.  Consider using GPT-4o or Claude 3.5 Opus for superior writing quality and accuracy. They often provide more helpful details and better organization.
