# Role
Expert Gig Economy Consultant specializing in Voiceover and AI Ethics.

# Context
Voice actors are increasingly presented with opportunities to license their voice data to technology companies for training AI text-to-speech (TTS) models. This represents a new revenue stream but also presents significant risks and requires careful consideration of contract terms. Many voice actors are unfamiliar with the specific nuances of AI licensing agreements.

# Task
Write a niche gig economy guide (approximately 700 words) for voice actors explaining the process of licensing their voice data to tech companies for AI training. The guide should:

1.  **Explain the Basics:** Clearly define what voice data licensing for AI training entails, including examples of how the data is used.
2.  **Highlight the Benefits:** Outline the potential financial benefits for voice actors.
3.  **Identify the Risks:** Discuss the potential risks, including unauthorized use, loss of control over their voice, and future market implications.
4.  **Address Contract Pitfalls:** Provide a detailed section on contract pitfalls to avoid, covering:
    *   Ownership of the voice model created.
    *   Exclusivity clauses and their implications.
    *   Usage restrictions (e.g., industries, types of content).
    *   Compensation models (lump sum vs. royalties).
    *   Data security and privacy measures.
    *   Liability and indemnification clauses.
    *   Termination clauses and their effects.
5.  **Offer Practical Advice:** Provide actionable advice on how voice actors can protect their interests, including:
    *   Consulting with legal professionals specializing in intellectual property and AI.
    *   Negotiating favorable contract terms.
    *   Maintaining awareness of industry best practices.
6. **Concluding statement:** End with a summary encouraging voice actors to approach these opportunities with informed caution and a proactive approach to protecting their voice identity.

# Constraints
1.  The guide should be written in a clear, concise, and accessible style, avoiding technical jargon where possible.
2.  Maintain a professional and informative tone, emphasizing the importance of due diligence.
3.  The guide should be unbiased, presenting both the opportunities and risks associated with voice data licensing.
4.  Do not provide legal advice. Clearly state that the guide is for informational purposes only and that voice actors should consult with legal professionals for specific guidance.
5.  Focus on practical and actionable advice that voice actors can immediately apply.

# Output Format
Markdown document.

## 💡 Pro Tips
1.  You can specify a target audience within voice actors (e.g., "newcomers", "seasoned professionals") to tailor the guide's language and level of detail.
2.  Providing examples of real-world voice licensing deals (anonymized, of course) will significantly improve the guide's practical relevance.
3.  Recommended Model: GPT-4o or Claude 3 Opus for their superior writing and reasoning capabilities. Consider using Google Gemini Advanced for fact-checking accuracy in complex legal and technical areas.
