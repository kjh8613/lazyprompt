# Role
Senior Home Improvement Analyst with 15 years of experience, specializing in energy efficiency and ROI calculations for residential properties.

# Context
A homeowner is considering encapsulating their crawl space to address concerns about humidity, air quality, and energy costs. They want a comprehensive analysis to determine if the upfront investment justifies the long-term benefits and potential energy savings. The homeowner lives in [Climate Zone - e.g., "Climate Zone 5A - Cold, Humid"]. The crawl space is approximately [Square Footage - e.g., "1200 square feet"]. Current energy bills average [Dollar Amount - e.g., "$250"] per month. The estimated cost for crawl space encapsulation is [Dollar Amount - e.g., "$8,000"].

# Task
1. **Summarize the benefits** of crawl space encapsulation, focusing on humidity control, indoor air quality improvement (mentioning common issues like mold and allergens), and potential energy savings. Provide specific examples and quantify these benefits where possible (e.g., "% reduction in humidity," "% improvement in air quality").
2. **Outline the typical costs** associated with crawl space encapsulation, including materials (vapor barrier, insulation, sump pump), labor, and potential additional expenses (e.g., pest control, structural repairs).
3. **Analyze the potential energy savings** resulting from encapsulation. Calculate the estimated annual energy savings in both percentage and dollar amount, considering the provided climate zone, crawl space size, and current energy bill. Explain the assumptions made in your calculations (e.g., R-value of insulation, typical heating/cooling degree days).
4. **Calculate the Return on Investment (ROI)** for the crawl space encapsulation project. Estimate the payback period based on the initial investment and annual energy savings. Consider potential increases in property value as a separate, qualitative factor in the ROI.
5. **Provide a balanced conclusion** that weighs the quantifiable financial benefits (energy savings, ROI) against the qualitative benefits (improved air quality, comfort, and potentially property value). Offer a recommendation on whether crawl space encapsulation is a worthwhile investment, considering the homeowner's specific circumstances. Acknowledge any limitations or uncertainties in your analysis.

# Constraints
1. The analysis must be objective and unbiased, presenting both the pros and cons of crawl space encapsulation.
2. Use a professional and informative tone, avoiding overly technical jargon or sales language.
3. Base your calculations and estimates on generally accepted industry standards and best practices. Cite your sources where appropriate (e.g., Energy Star, Building Science Corporation).
4. The response should be approximately 500-700 words in length.
5. Do not recommend specific brands or contractors.

# Output Format
Markdown format, using headings, bullet points, and clear paragraphs to organize the information. Include a table summarizing the costs, savings, and ROI.

## 💡 Pro Tips
1. Customize the bracketed [ ] placeholders with accurate information for the most relevant analysis. The more specific the details, the better the result.
2. If you have access to local energy prices or utility bill data, include that information for a more precise energy savings calculation.
3. Recommended model: GPT-4o for its strong reasoning and information retrieval capabilities. Claude 3.5 Sonnet is a good alternative if you need more creative formatting.
