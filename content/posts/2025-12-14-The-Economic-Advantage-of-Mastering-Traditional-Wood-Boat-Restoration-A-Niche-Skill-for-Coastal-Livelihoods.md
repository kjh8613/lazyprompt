## 💡 Pro Tips
1.  **[Title Customization]:** Before pasting, consider adding a catchy and descriptive title to the prompt itself, or guide the AI to generate one. For instance, you could add "Generate a title for the blog post that is engaging and hints at both profit and passion."
2.  **[Target Audience Nuances]:** If you want to emphasize a particular demographic within the "affluent boat owner" group (e.g., owners of specific classic yacht makes, or those involved in historical reenactments), you can add this detail to the "Context" section.
3.  **[Geographic Focus]:** While "North American coastlines" is general, if you want to highlight specific regions (e.g., New England, Pacific Northwest, Great Lakes), you can add this detail to the "Context" to tailor the demand aspect.
4.  **[Recommended Model]:** For the best results, use a powerful language model like GPT-4o, Claude 3.5 Sonnet, or Gemini Advanced. These models excel at creative writing, detailed explanations, and incorporating specific keywords naturally.
