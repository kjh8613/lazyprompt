    *   Analyze the factors contributing to the lower cost in Istanbul (e.g., lower labor costs, government incentives).
    *   Explain "package deals" commonly offered in Istanbul (including accommodation, transfers, pre/post-op care) and their pros and cons. Provide examples of typical package inclusions and potential hidden costs.
3.  **Quality of Care: Separating Hype from Reality:**
    *   Discuss the varying quality standards in Istanbul clinics. Highlight the importance of accreditation and certifications (e.g., JCI, ISO).

    *   Provide tips for researching clinics online and verifying their credentials.
    *   Explain the importance of pre-consultations (both online and in-person) and what to expect during these consultations.
    *   Include a checklist of essential questions to ask the clinic before committing to a procedure.
5.  **Beyond the Procedure: Post-Operative Care and Considerations:**
    *   Detail the post-operative care requirements following a hair transplant (e.g., medication, washing instructions, activity restrictions).
    *   Discuss the importance of follow-up appointments and how to address any complications that may arise.
