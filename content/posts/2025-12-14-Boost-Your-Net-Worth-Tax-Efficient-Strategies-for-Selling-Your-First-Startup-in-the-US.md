# Role
You are a highly experienced tax advisor and business strategist specializing in startup exits in the United States. Your expertise lies in translating complex tax laws into actionable advice for entrepreneurs.

# Context
Aspiring entrepreneurs and early-stage startup founders in the United States are seeking to understand how to minimize capital gains tax liabilities when they eventually sell their first business. They need clear, practical, and legally sound strategies to boost their net worth upon exit. This includes understanding available deductions and deferral techniques.

# Task
Write a comprehensive, actionable, and legally sound blog post titled "Boost Your Net Worth: Tax-Efficient Strategies for Selling Your First Startup in the US". The blog post should:
1.  **Introduce the Challenge:** Briefly explain the significant tax implications of selling a startup and why proactive tax planning is crucial.
2.  **Explain Capital Gains Tax:** Provide a concise overview of long-term vs. short-term capital gains tax in the US.
3.  **Detail Tax-Efficient Strategies:**
    *   **Strategies for Minimizing Immediate Tax Liability:**
        *   Discuss the **Qualified Small Business Stock (QSBS)** exclusion (Section 1202). Explain eligibility criteria and how founders can qualify.
        *   Explain the benefit of **holding periods** for long-term capital gains.
        *   Mention the potential for **structuring the sale** (e.g., asset sale vs. stock sale, and when each might be more tax-efficient, noting the impact on ordinary income vs. capital gains).
    *   **Strategies for Deferring Tax Liability:**
        *   Explain **1031 Exchanges** (like-kind exchanges) and their applicability to business assets (though less common for stock sales, it can apply to asset sales if reinvested in similar business property).
        *   Discuss **Opportunity Zones** and how investing capital gains into qualified opportunity zone funds can defer and potentially reduce taxes.
        *   Explain the concept of **Installment Sales** and how it allows for spreading taxable gains over multiple years.
4.  **Illustrate with Examples:**
    *   Provide a clear, hypothetical example of how QSBS exclusion would work for a founder.
    *   Provide a hypothetical example of using Opportunity Zones to reinvest sale proceeds.
5.  **Incorporate a Table:** Include a comparative table of common exit strategies (e.g., IPO, Acquisition by Strategic Buyer, Acquisition by Private Equity, Management Buyout) and their general tax implications (focusing on capital gains vs. ordinary income, and potential for deferral/exclusion).
6.  **Provide Actionable Steps:** Offer a step-by-step guide or checklist on what founders should do *before* and *during* the exit process to maximize tax efficiency.
7.  **Disclaimer:** Include a clear disclaimer that this is not financial or legal advice and founders should consult with qualified professionals.

# Constraints
1.  **Tone:** Informative, authoritative, encouraging, and accessible to entrepreneurs without deep tax knowledge. Avoid overly technical jargon where possible, or explain it clearly.
2.  **Legality:** All strategies discussed must be legally sound and based on current US tax law. Avoid suggesting any loopholes or questionable practices.
3.  **Clarity:** Focus on providing clear, step-by-step guidance. Use headings, subheadings, bullet points, and bold text to improve readability.
4.  **Exclusivity:** The focus is specifically on *US tax law* and *selling a first startup*.
5.  **Length:** Aim for a comprehensive blog post that is detailed enough to be valuable but not so long as to be overwhelming. (Approx. 1500-2000 words).

# Output Format
Markdown. The blog post should include:
*   A clear title.
*   An introduction and conclusion.
*   Well-structured sections with headings and subheadings.
*   A comparative table formatted in Markdown.
*   Bulleted or numbered lists for actionable steps.
*   A disclaimer.
```

## 💡 Pro Tips
1.  When filling in the [ ] placeholders in the prompt, consider adding specifics about your target audience's industry or typical startup valuation range if you want to tailor the examples further.
2.  For even better results, you can specify the exact US state the blog post should be geared towards, as some states have different capital gains tax treatments.
3.  **Recommended Model:** GPT-4o, Claude 3.5 Sonnet, or Gemini Advanced. These models excel at handling complex instructions, maintaining tone, and generating detailed, accurate content.
