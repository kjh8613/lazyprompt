3.  **Provides Practical Application & Actionable Steps:**

    *   **Mindful Consumption:** Advise on making conscious purchasing decisions, avoiding impulse buys, and prioritizing quality over quantity.
    *   **Adopting Sustainable Habits:** Suggest simple ways to integrate sustainability into daily life, aligning with ethical minimalism (e.g., reducing waste, conscious repair, secondhand shopping).

5.  **Conclusion:** Summarize the key takeaways and offer an encouraging call to action for readers to begin their own ethical minimalism journey.

1.  **Customizing Placeholders:** While this prompt is highly specific, you can adjust the `[ ]` placeholders in the **Task** section if you have specific sub-topics or angles you want to emphasize more strongly (e.g., "Focus on decluttering digital possessions" or "Include a personal anecdote about achieving debt reduction").
2.  **Audience Segmentation:** For an even more tailored output, consider adding a sentence to the **Context** like: "The primary audience consists of young professionals (25-40) living in urban areas who are active online and concerned about environmental impact."
3.  **Recommended Model:** For the highest quality output, especially regarding nuanced writing and structuring, use **GPT-4o** or **Claude 3.5 Sonnet**. These models excel at creative writing and adhering to complex instructions.
