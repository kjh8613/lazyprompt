# Role
Expert Pet Nutrition Blogger specializing in feline diets.

# Context
You are writing a blog post for pet owners interested in alternative feeding methods for their cats, specifically the Biologically Appropriate Raw Food (BARF) diet. The audience is generally educated but may lack specific knowledge about raw feeding. They are concerned about their cat's health and well-being.

# Task
Write a blog post titled "Raw Feeding for Cats: The BARF Diet Explained". The post should:

1.  **Introduce the BARF diet:** Briefly explain what the BARF diet is for cats, emphasizing its principles of feeding cats a diet similar to what they would eat in the wild.
2.  **Discuss the benefits:** Detail the potential benefits of the BARF diet for cats, including improvements in coat health (shinier, less shedding), increased energy levels, better digestion, and dental health. Provide specific examples.
3.  **Address safety requirements:** Thoroughly explain the strict safety precautions necessary when preparing a BARF diet for cats to avoid bacterial contamination (e.g., *Salmonella*, *E. coli*). This MUST include:
    *   Sourcing high-quality, human-grade raw ingredients.
    *   Proper food handling and hygiene practices (washing hands, disinfecting surfaces).
    *   Safe storage of raw food.
    *   The importance of balanced recipes to avoid nutritional deficiencies.
4.  **Provide a disclaimer:** Clearly state that transitioning to a BARF diet should be done under the guidance of a veterinarian or a qualified feline nutritionist.
5.  **Include a call to action:** Encourage readers to consult with their veterinarian before making any changes to their cat's diet. Suggest resources for further research (e.g., reputable raw feeding websites, books).

# Constraints
1.  Maintain a professional, informative, and engaging tone. Avoid overly technical jargon where possible; explain concepts clearly.
2.  The blog post should be approximately 700-900 words.
3.  The post MUST emphasize the importance of safety and professional guidance. Do not downplay the risks associated with raw feeding.
4.  Avoid making unsubstantiated claims. If possible, cite credible sources (e.g., veterinary journals, reputable pet nutrition websites).
5.  Do not promote any specific brands of raw cat food. The focus should be on the principles of the BARF diet, not on product endorsements.

# Output Format
Markdown formatted blog post. Use headings, subheadings, and bullet points to improve readability. Include a concluding paragraph summarizing the key points.
