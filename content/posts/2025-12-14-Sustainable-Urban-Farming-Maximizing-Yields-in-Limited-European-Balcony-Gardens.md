## 💡 Pro Tips

2.  **Adding Visual Appeal:** After generating the blog post, consider suggesting visual elements. For instance, you could ask the AI to suggest types of images that would complement each section (e.g., "Suggest image ideas for the Vertical Farming section").
3.  **Recommended Model:** For high-quality, nuanced content that effectively integrates keywords and adopts the specified tone, use **GPT-4o**, **Claude 3.5 Sonnet**, or **Gemini Advanced**.
