# Role
Expert DIY Project Planner & Experienced Cat Owner

# Context
Many indoor cat owners want to provide their feline companions with safe access to the outdoors. Building a "catio" (cat patio) is an excellent solution that protects both cats and local wildlife. This guide needs to be detailed and accessible to individuals with varying levels of DIY experience.

# Task
Develop a comprehensive DIY guide for building a catio. The guide should cover the following:

1.  **Introduction:** Briefly explain the benefits of a catio for cat health and bird safety.
2.  **Materials List:**  Provide a detailed list of necessary materials, including various wire mesh options (gauge, hole size recommendations for cat safety), framing materials (wood types, pressure-treated vs. untreated), hardware (screws, nails, hinges, latches), and optional materials (shelves, scratching posts, roofing). Specify quantities needed for a small window box catio and a larger standalone catio.
3.  **Tools List:** List all necessary tools for the project (saw, drill, measuring tape, staple gun, wire cutters, etc.).
4.  **Design Options:** Present two distinct catio designs:
    *   **Window Box Catio:** Step-by-step instructions for building a catio that attaches to a window. Include details on securing the structure to the window frame and ensuring a safe and comfortable transition for the cat. Provide approximate dimensions for a small to medium sized cat.
    *   **Standalone Catio:** Step-by-step instructions for building a larger, standalone catio. Include options for attaching it to the house (e.g., via a cat door) or placing it independently in the yard.  Include details on building a foundation or base to prevent digging. Provide approximate dimensions for a small (1-2 cats) and medium (3-4 cats) sized catio.
5.  **Construction Steps:** Provide clear, numbered steps for each design option, including cutting lumber, assembling the frame, attaching the wire mesh, and adding finishing touches (shelves, perches, etc.). Include diagrams or sketches where appropriate.
6.  **Safety Considerations:** Emphasize safety precautions throughout the guide, including using appropriate safety gear, working in a well-ventilated area, and ensuring the structure is stable and secure. Highlight the importance of using non-toxic materials.
7.  **Bird Safety:** Explain how catios protect birds by preventing cats from hunting them. Recommend features like solid roofs or overhanging eaves to further deter birds from landing on the catio.
8.  **Maintenance Tips:** Provide tips on cleaning the catio, checking for damage, and making necessary repairs.

# Constraints
1.  The guide should be written in a clear, concise, and easy-to-understand style, suitable for readers with limited DIY experience.
2.  All measurements should be provided in both imperial (inches, feet) and metric (centimeters, meters) units.
3.  The guide must be comprehensive and cover all aspects of catio construction, from planning to maintenance.
4.  Avoid overly technical jargon. If technical terms are necessary, provide clear explanations.
5.  Maintain a positive and encouraging tone throughout the guide, emphasizing the rewards of building a safe and enriching outdoor space for cats.

# Output Format
Markdown document with headings, subheadings, lists, and numbered steps. Include example diagrams using Mermaid syntax where appropriate.

## 💡 Pro Tips
1.  Customize the design options to match your cat's personality and available space. Provide more specific dimensions if you have a particular location in mind.
2.  Include your budget and skill level when describing the materials and tools. This will help the AI tailor the guide to your specific needs.
3.  Recommended model: GPT-4o provides excellent results in generating well-structured and detailed guides with diagrams. Experiment with Claude 3.5 Sonnet for alternative phrasing and layout.
