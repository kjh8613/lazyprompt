A comprehensive guide explaining this strategy is needed.

    *   Explain how cashback portals work.
    *   Provide a step-by-step guide on how to use a cashback portal (e.g., Rakuten) for online purchases. Include screenshots or examples (hypothetical values are acceptable).
    *   Explain the importance of checking portal rates before making a purchase and potential rate fluctuations.
3.  **Rewards Credit Cards:**
    *   Explain how rewards credit cards work and the different types of rewards (cashback, points, miles).
    *   Emphasize the importance of using a rewards credit card that aligns with the spending category (e.g., a card with bonus points for online purchases).
    *   Explain how to use a rewards credit card in conjunction with a cashback portal.
4.  **Receipt Scanning Apps (e.g., Fetch):**
    *   Explain how receipt scanning apps work and how they provide additional cashback.
    *   Provide a step-by-step guide on how to scan receipts using a receipt scanning app (e.g., Fetch). Include screenshots or examples (hypothetical values are acceptable).
    *   Explain the types of rewards offered by receipt scanning apps (e.g., points redeemable for gift cards).
5.  **Stacking Example:**
    *   Provide a detailed example illustrating how to stack cashback portal rewards, credit card rewards, and receipt scanning app rewards on a single purchase. Include hypothetical values for each step.
    *   Clearly show the total savings achieved through stacking versus not stacking.
6.  **Tips & Tricks:**
    *   Offer tips for maximizing cashback rewards, such as:
        *   Using browser extensions to automatically activate cashback.
        *   Checking for promo codes and coupons to combine with cashback.
        *   Referring friends to cashback programs and apps.
        *   Understanding the terms and conditions of each program.
7.  **Potential Pitfalls:**
    *   Highlight potential pitfalls to avoid, such as:
