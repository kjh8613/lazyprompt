# Role
You are a seasoned and highly knowledgeable tax advisor specializing in historic preservation incentives for residential properties in the United States.

# Context
I am a homeowner in the United States who owns a historic property and is planning significant renovations. I want to understand the financial benefits available through tax credits to help offset the costs of preservation. I need a detailed explanation of federal and state-level tax credits, including how to qualify, what expenses are eligible, and the process for claiming them. I also need clear guidance on documenting expenses for tax purposes and examples of qualifying projects. The ultimate goal is to maximize the economic benefits of these incentives.

# Task
Create a comprehensive blog post titled "Maximizing Tax Credits for Historic Home Renovations: A US Homeowner's Guide to Preservation Incentives." The blog post should cover the following sections in detail:

1.  **Introduction:** Briefly introduce the importance of historic preservation and the financial advantages of tax credits for homeowners.
2.  **Federal Historic Preservation Tax Credit:**
    *   Explain the primary federal program (e.g., the Historic Preservation Tax Credit).
    *   Detail the eligibility criteria for both the property (National Register of Historic Places, certified historic structure) and the homeowner.
    *   Clarify the types of qualified rehabilitation expenses (QREs) that can be claimed.
    *   Explain the credit calculation and how it's applied (e.g., percentage of QREs).
    *   Outline the process for applying for and claiming this credit, including necessary certifications (e.g., State Historic Preservation Offices (SHPOs), National Park Service).
3.  **State-Level Historic Preservation Tax Credits:**
    *   Explain that many states offer their own tax credits, which can often be used in conjunction with federal credits.
    *   Provide a general overview of how state credits work, mentioning that they vary significantly by state.
    *   Advise homeowners to research their specific state's programs.
    *   Briefly discuss potential overlap or synergy between federal and state credits.
4.  **Eligibility Criteria Deep Dive:**
    *   Elaborate on what constitutes a "certified historic structure."
    *   Define "substantial rehabilitation" and its implications.
    *   Explain the "non-income-producing" property aspect for homeowners and its impact on credit availability.
5.  **Qualified Rehabilitation Expenses (QREs):**
    *   Provide clear examples of what typically qualifies (e.g., repair of historic features, replacement of historically accurate materials, lead paint abatement, structural work).
    *   List common renovation expenses that *do not* qualify (e.g., new additions not in keeping with historic character, landscaping, furniture).
6.  **Step-by-Step Guide to Documenting Expenses:**
    *   Provide a clear, actionable process for homeowners to track and document all renovation expenses for tax purposes. This should include:
        *   Keeping all original invoices and receipts, detailing work performed and materials used.
        *   Obtaining written contracts for all significant work.
        *   Categorizing expenses (e.g., materials, labor, architectural fees, permit fees).
        *   Photographing the property before, during, and after renovations.
        *   Maintaining communication with SHPOs throughout the process.
        *   Understanding depreciation rules if applicable.
7.  **Common Renovation Projects That Qualify:**
    *   Provide specific examples of typical historic home renovation projects that are likely to qualify for these credits (e.g., restoring original windows, repairing or replacing historic roofing, plaster repair, masonry work, updating systems while preserving historic integrity).
8.  **Economic Benefits and Conclusion:**
    *   Highlight the potential financial savings and increased property value.
    *   Emphasize the long-term benefits of preservation.
    *   Encourage homeowners to consult with professionals.

# Constraints
1.  **Target Audience & Tone:** Write in an accessible, informative, and encouraging tone suitable for a homeowner with no prior tax or preservation expertise. Avoid overly technical jargon where possible, or explain it clearly if necessary.
2.  **Accuracy & Detail:** Ensure all information regarding federal tax credits is accurate and up-to-date (or clearly state if it's a general overview subject to change). Provide enough detail for homeowners to understand the implications and next steps.
3.  **Keyword Integration:** Naturally weave in the target keywords throughout the blog post: "historic home renovation tax credits," "preservation tax incentives US," "qualified rehabilitation expenses," "federal historic tax credit," "state historic preservation tax credits," "renovating old houses tax benefits," and "American historic homes."
4.  **Structure & Readability:** Use clear headings, subheadings, bullet points, and numbered lists to break up text and improve readability.
5.  **Disclaimer:** Include a clear disclaimer advising homeowners to consult with qualified tax professionals and their state's historic preservation office for personalized advice, as tax laws and program specifics can vary.
6.  **No Legal/Financial Advice:** Frame the content as informational and educational, not as direct legal or financial advice.

# Output Format
A well-structured Markdown document suitable for a blog post, including a title, introduction, distinct sections with headings and subheadings, bullet points, and a concluding section.

## 💡 Pro Tips
1.  **Placeholder Customization:** While this prompt is designed to be comprehensive, you can further tailor it by adding specific state tax credit details if you know which state the homeowner is in. For example, you could add a note like: `"[Optional: If the user provides a specific state, research and briefly mention its most prominent historic preservation tax credit program.]"`
2.  **Additional Information:** For the AI to provide the most accurate federal information, you could add: "Focus on the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act of 2017's impact on the Historic Tax Credit, particularly the reduction of the credit from 20% to 10% for non-historic buildings, and the changes to the credit for income-producing properties, while emphasizing the benefits for qualifying homeowners undertaking substantial rehabilitation of certified historic structures."
3.  **Recommended Model:** GPT-4o, Claude 3.5 Sonnet, or Gemini Advanced. These models excel at generating detailed, well-structured, and accurate content on complex topics while maintaining an accessible tone.
