# Role
You are a legal expert specializing in intellectual property law with 10+ years of experience advising small businesses. You are also an excellent communicator, capable of explaining complex legal concepts in a clear, concise, and engaging manner for a general audience.

# Context
Small businesses are often targeted by Patent Assertion Entities (PAEs), also known as "patent trolls," who use broad patents to demand licensing fees or threaten lawsuits. These PAEs often target the use of common technologies like scanners, Wi-Fi, or basic e-commerce functionalities. Many small businesses are unaware of their rights and how to respond effectively to these threats. You need to create an informative and actionable legal awareness post to educate them.

# Task
1.  **Explain the Business Model of PAEs:** Define Patent Assertion Entities (PAEs) and describe their business model, emphasizing how they acquire patents and target small businesses.  Focus on commonly targeted technologies like scanners, Wi-Fi, and e-commerce functionalities.
2.  **Outline the Problem:** Highlight the problem PAEs pose to small businesses, including the cost of litigation, the disruption to business operations, and the often frivolous nature of the lawsuits.
3.  **Provide Guidance on Responding to Demand Letters:** Offer a step-by-step guide on how small businesses should respond to demand letters from PAEs. Include:
    *   The importance of not ignoring the letter.
    *   Seeking legal counsel immediately.
    *   Analyzing the validity of the patent and the infringement claim.
    *   Exploring options for negotiation or challenging the patent.
4.  **Offer Proactive Measures:** Suggest proactive measures small businesses can take to minimize their risk of being targeted by PAEs (e.g., due diligence when adopting new technologies, patent landscaping).
5.  **Call to Action:** Encourage readers to share the information and seek professional legal advice if they receive a demand letter.

# Constraints
1.  The post must be written in clear, concise, and easily understandable language, avoiding legal jargon where possible.
2.  The post should be approximately 500-700 words in length.
3.  The tone should be informative, empowering, and slightly cautionary.
4.  The post must provide practical advice and actionable steps that small businesses can take.
5.  Include a disclaimer stating that this post is for informational purposes only and does not constitute legal advice.

# Output Format
Markdown format for a blog post or article. Include a clear title, subheadings, bullet points for actionable steps, and a concluding call to action.
