# Role
Act as a highly experienced Small Business Tax Consultant and Content Writer, specializing in government incentives for employers.

# Context
A small business owner is looking to understand how to reduce their tax liability while expanding their team. They have heard about the Work Opportunity Tax Credit (WOTC) but need a clear, actionable explanation of what it is, which targeted groups qualify, and how to claim the potential tax credits, which can be up to $9,600 per eligible new hire. The business owner needs this information presented in a way that is easy for a non-expert to understand and implement.

# Task
Create a concise, informative, and actionable hiring guide for small business owners about the Work Opportunity Tax Credit (WOTC). The guide should cover the following key areas:
1.  **What is the WOTC?** Briefly explain the purpose of the credit.
2.  **How much can you save?** Detail the potential tax credit amounts, specifically mentioning the up to $9,600 figure and what it is based on (e.g., wages paid, hours worked, type of target group).
3.  **Who are the Targeted Groups?** List and briefly describe at least three key targeted groups that qualify for WOTC, such as:
    *   Qualified Veterans
    *   Qualified Ex-Felons
    *   Long-Term Unemployed Individuals
    *   (Include 1-2 other common WOTC groups if relevant and concise).
4.  **Eligibility Requirements for New Hires:** Outline general criteria for employees to qualify for the credit.
5.  **How to Claim the WOTC:** Provide a step-by-step process for employers to claim the credit, including:
    *   The importance of pre-screening and obtaining certifications.
    *   The necessary IRS forms (mentioning Form 3800 and any relevant supplemental forms like Form 5884).
    *   The deadline for submitting certifications.
6.  **Benefits for Small Businesses:** Briefly summarize why this credit is beneficial.
7.  **Call to Action/Next Steps:** Encourage employers to explore the WOTC further, consult with tax professionals, or visit relevant government resources (e.g., IRS website, Department of Labor).

# Constraints
1.  **Tone:** Professional, encouraging, and easy-to-understand. Avoid overly technical jargon where possible, or explain it clearly.
2.  **Length:** Aim for a guide that is approximately 500-700 words.
3.  **Clarity:** Prioritize actionable steps and clear explanations of benefits and processes.
4.  **Accuracy:** Ensure all information regarding the credit, targeted groups, and claim process is factually correct based on general WOTC guidelines.
5.  **No Legal/Tax Advice Disclaimer:** Include a standard disclaimer stating that this information is for educational purposes and not a substitute for professional tax advice.

# Output Format
A well-structured Markdown document with clear headings, subheadings, and bullet points for readability.
```

## 💡 Pro Tips
1.  **[Target Audience Refinement]:** If you have a specific industry in mind (e.g., hospitality, construction), you can add that to the `Context` to tailor the examples further.
2.  **[Specific State Programs]:** While WOTC is federal, some states have additional incentives. You can ask the AI to mention the possibility of state-specific programs in the `Call to Action/Next Steps`.
3.  **[Recommended Model]:** GPT-4o, Claude 3.5 Sonnet, or Gemini Advanced are recommended for their strong writing and comprehension capabilities.
