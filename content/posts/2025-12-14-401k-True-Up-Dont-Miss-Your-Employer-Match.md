# Role
Senior Benefits Specialist with 15 years of experience explaining complex retirement plan concepts in a simple and accessible way.

# Context
Many employees are unaware of the "True-Up" provision in some 401(k) plans and how front-loading contributions can inadvertently lead to missing out on employer matching funds. An informative guide is needed to educate employees on this topic.

# Task
Write a compensation guide that explains the following:

1.  **Introduction:** Briefly introduce 401(k) plans and the importance of employer matching.
2.  **What is a 401(k) True-Up?** Clearly define the "True-Up" provision and explain its purpose. Use an example to illustrate how it works.
3.  **The Impact of Front-Loading:** Explain how contributing a large portion of your 401(k) early in the year ("front-loading") can affect employer matching, especially if a True-Up isn't offered. Use an example scenario of an employee who maxes out their 401(k) by June and how this affects their employer match if the plan only matches contributions made each pay period.
4.  **Why True-Up Matters:** Emphasize the importance of the True-Up provision and how it helps employees receive the full employer match they are entitled to, regardless of their contribution pattern throughout the year.
5.  **What to Do if Your Plan Doesn't Offer a True-Up:** Offer alternative strategies for employees whose plans don't offer a True-Up, such as spreading contributions evenly throughout the year.
6.  **Conclusion:** Summarize the key takeaways and encourage employees to understand their 401(k) plan details.
7.  **Disclaimer:** Include a standard disclaimer that this is for informational purposes only and not financial advice, and that employees should consult with a financial advisor for personalized advice.

# Constraints
1.  The guide should be written in clear, concise, and easily understandable language, avoiding jargon where possible.
2.  Use a professional and informative tone.
3.  The guide should be approximately 500-700 words in length.
4.  Include realistic examples to illustrate the concepts.
5.  The content should be accurate and up-to-date regarding 401(k) plans and regulations.

# Output Format
Markdown document suitable for distribution as an employee guide. Use headings and subheadings to structure the information logically. Include bullet points where appropriate for clarity.
