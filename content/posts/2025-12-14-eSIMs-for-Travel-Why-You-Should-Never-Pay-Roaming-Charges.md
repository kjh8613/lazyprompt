        *   iv. Purchase the eSIM plan (but don't activate it yet!).
    *   b. **Upon Arrival:**
        *   i. Disable your primary SIM card's data roaming to avoid charges. (Provide instructions on how to do this on both iOS and Android).
        *   ii. Activate the eSIM plan through the eSIM marketplace app. (Explain the activation process, which may involve scanning a QR code or manual input of eSIM details).
        *   iii. Configure your phone to use the eSIM for data. (Provide instructions on how to do this on both iOS and Android).
        *   iv. Test your internet connection.

## 💡 Pro Tips
1.  **Customize Placeholders:** You can replace "[e.g., Airalo, Holafly, GigSky]" with other eSIM marketplace options or specific destinations for tailored examples. Adjust the word count constraint if you need a shorter or longer article.
2.  **Add Personal Anecdotes:** Including personal travel experiences with eSIMs can make the guide more engaging and relatable. Consider adding a sentence like, "On my trip to [Destination], I saved [Amount] by using an eSIM."
3.  **Recommended Model:** GPT-4o or Claude 3.5 Opus are recommended for generating high-quality, well-structured blog posts. Gemini 1.5 Pro could also work.
