# Role
Healthcare Finance Expert with 10+ years of experience, specializing in Flexible Spending Accounts (FSAs) and Health Savings Accounts (HSAs).

# Context
Many individuals struggle to fully utilize their Flexible Spending Account (FSA) funds by the end of the year, leading to forfeited money due to the "use it or lose it" rule. They are unaware of the wide range of eligible expenses beyond typical medical bills and prescriptions. This guide aims to educate FSA holders on surprising eligible items and strategies for maximizing their FSA benefits.

# Task
Write a comprehensive healthcare finance guide explaining how to avoid forfeiting FSA funds by highlighting surprising eligible items and providing actionable tips. The guide should include the following sections:

1.  **Introduction to FSAs:** Briefly explain what an FSA is, its benefits, and the "use it or lose it" rule.
2.  **Surprisingly Eligible Items:** Detail a list of unexpectedly eligible FSA expenses, including but not limited to:
    *   Sunscreen (SPF 30 or higher)
    *   Massages (with a Letter of Medical Necessity - LMN)
    *   First Aid Kits and supplies
    *   Over-the-counter medications (with a prescription, if required)
    *   Menstrual products
    *   Reading glasses
    *   Acupuncture
    *   Mileage to and from medical appointments
3.  **How to Determine Eligibility:** Explain how to check if an item or service is FSA eligible (e.g., using the FSA store website, contacting your FSA administrator, or consulting IRS Publication 502).
4.  **Strategies to Avoid Forfeiting Funds:** Offer practical tips for spending down FSA funds before the deadline, such as:
    *   Planning purchases in advance.
    *   Stocking up on eligible items.
    *   Scheduling medical appointments or procedures.
    *   Understanding grace periods and rollover options (if offered by your employer).
5.  **Conclusion:** Summarize the key takeaways and encourage readers to take proactive steps to maximize their FSA benefits.

# Constraints
*   The guide should be written in clear, concise, and easy-to-understand language, avoiding technical jargon whenever possible.
*   Maintain a helpful and informative tone.
*   The guide should be approximately 500-700 words in length.
*   Include links to relevant resources, such as the FSA Store website or IRS Publication 502 (where appropriate and readily available). Hyperlinks are not required but are encouraged if easily found.
*   Do not provide financial advice. Focus on explaining FSA rules and eligible expenses.

## 💡 Pro Tips
1.  Customize the "Surprisingly Eligible Items" section by adding or removing items relevant to your specific audience. Research and ensure accuracy.
2.  Provide a specific dollar amount remaining in the FSA when prompting, and ask the AI to provide a personalized spending plan to deplete that amount. For example: "I have $300 left in my FSA. Suggest a detailed spending plan."
3.  Recommended model: GPT-4o, Claude 3.5 Sonnet, Gemini 1.5 Pro. Consider using a model with internet access for up-to-date information on FSA eligibility.
