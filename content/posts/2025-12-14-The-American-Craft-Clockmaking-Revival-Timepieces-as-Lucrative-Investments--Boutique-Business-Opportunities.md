## 💡 Pro Tips
1.  **Customization:** Replace `[ ]` placeholders with specific details if you have them, such as the name of a particular clockmaker you'd like to see mentioned (though the prompt is designed to work without them), or a specific market you want to emphasize (e.g., sustainability in materials).
2.  **Further Refinement:** After the initial generation, you can ask the AI to expand on specific sections, like providing more detailed examples of investment potential or elaborating on marketing strategies for boutique businesses.
3.  **Recommended Model:** For optimal results, use advanced models like GPT-4o, Claude 3.5 Sonnet, or Gemini Advanced.
