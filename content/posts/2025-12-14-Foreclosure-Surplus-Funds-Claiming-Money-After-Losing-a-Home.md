# Role
Financial Recovery Expert & Author specializing in post-foreclosure surplus fund recovery, known for clear, empathetic, and actionable advice.

# Context
A significant number of homes are foreclosed upon each year. When a foreclosed property sells for more than the outstanding debt (mortgage, fees, etc.), the difference is considered "surplus funds." Many former homeowners are unaware they are legally entitled to these funds, which often go unclaimed, ending up with the state or county.

# Task
Write a comprehensive yet easy-to-understand guide titled "Foreclosure Surplus Funds: Your Guide to Reclaiming What's Yours After Losing Your Home". The guide MUST include the following sections:

1.  **Introduction:** Briefly explain what foreclosure surplus funds are and why they often go unclaimed. Emphasize the legal right of the former homeowner to these funds. Include a brief, empathetic statement acknowledging the difficulty of losing a home.
2.  **Understanding Surplus Funds:** Define "surplus funds" in detail, explaining how they are calculated (sale price minus debt and expenses). Provide a hypothetical example with specific numbers to illustrate the calculation.
3.  **Why Surplus Funds Go Unclaimed:** Explain the common reasons why former homeowners don't claim surplus funds (e.g., lack of awareness, difficulty locating the funds, belief they are not entitled, complex legal processes).
4.  **How to Find Out if You Have Surplus Funds:** Provide a step-by-step guide on how to research and determine if surplus funds exist. This should include:
    *   Checking public records (county clerk, recorder's office).
    *   Contacting the foreclosing entity (bank, mortgage servicer).
    *   Searching online databases or websites.
    *   Mentioning the possibility of being contacted by third-party companies offering assistance (and a warning about their fees).
5.  **The Claim Process:** Detail the steps involved in claiming surplus funds. This should include:
    *   Required documentation (identification, proof of ownership, etc.).
    *   Filing a claim with the appropriate entity (court, county treasurer).
    *   Deadlines for filing claims.
    *   Potential legal assistance.
6.  **Potential Challenges and How to Overcome Them:** Discuss common obstacles in claiming surplus funds (e.g., competing claims, incorrect contact information, complex legal requirements) and offer practical advice on how to address them.
7.  **Warning About Scams:** Provide a clear and strong warning about foreclosure rescue scams and companies that promise to recover surplus funds for a large fee. Advise readers to be cautious and to research any company before hiring them.
8.  **Resources and Further Assistance:** List relevant government agencies, legal aid organizations, and non-profit groups that can provide free or low-cost assistance.
9.  **Conclusion:** Reiterate the importance of claiming surplus funds and provide a final call to action, encouraging readers to take the necessary steps to recover what is rightfully theirs.

# Constraints
*   The tone should be empathetic, informative, and empowering.
*   Avoid overly technical jargon; use plain language.
*   Focus on providing actionable steps and practical advice.
*   The guide should be approximately 1500-2000 words in length.
*   Assume the reader has limited knowledge of legal or financial terminology.

# Output Format
Markdown document. Use headings, subheadings, bullet points, and numbered lists to organize the information clearly. Include a hypothetical example within the "Understanding Surplus Funds" section.
```

## 💡 Pro Tips
1.  Customize the [Resources and Further Assistance] section with links to resources relevant to specific geographical areas if known.
2.  Provide the AI with example surplus fund claim forms from a specific state/county for even greater accuracy in the Claim Process section. This will require you to modify the prompt slightly to accommodate the added context.
3.  Recommended Model: GPT-4o or Claude 3.5 Sonnet for best results, but GPT-3.5 will also produce a useful guide.
