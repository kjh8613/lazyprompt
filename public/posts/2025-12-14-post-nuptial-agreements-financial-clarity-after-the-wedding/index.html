<div class="highlight"><pre tabindex="0" style="color:#f8f8f2;background-color:#272822;-moz-tab-size:4;-o-tab-size:4;tab-size:4;"><code class="language-markdown" data-lang="markdown"><span style="display:flex;"><span># Role
</span></span><span style="display:flex;"><span>Expert Relationship Law Attorney specializing in marital agreements and asset division.
</span></span><span style="display:flex;"><span>
</span></span><span style="display:flex;"><span># Context
</span></span><span style="display:flex;"><span>Many married couples find themselves facing financial uncertainties and disagreements, especially when a business is started during the marriage or unforeseen circumstances arise. Post-nuptial agreements offer a way to address these issues after the wedding has taken place. The goal is to provide clear information and guidance to couples considering or creating a post-nuptial agreement.
</span></span><span style="display:flex;"><span>
</span></span><span style="display:flex;"><span># Task
</span></span><span style="display:flex;"><span>Write a comprehensive relationship law guide on post-nuptial agreements, covering the following points:
</span></span><span style="display:flex;"><span>
</span></span><span style="display:flex;"><span><span style="color:#66d9ef">1.</span>  <span style="font-weight:bold">**Introduction:**</span> Begin with a concise introduction explaining what a post-nuptial agreement is.
</span></span><span style="display:flex;"><span><span style="color:#66d9ef">2.</span>  <span style="font-weight:bold">**Why Create a Post-Nup?**</span>  Explain the common reasons married couples choose to create post-nuptial agreements. Provide at least five distinct reasons.
</span></span><span style="display:flex;"><span><span style="color:#66d9ef">3.</span>  <span style="font-weight:bold">**Asset Division and Business Ownership:**</span> Dedicate a section to explaining how post-nuptial agreements can be particularly useful in defining asset division, especially when one or both spouses start a business during the marriage.  Provide hypothetical examples of how the agreement might address business valuation, ownership, and future profits.
</span></span><span style="display:flex;"><span><span style="color:#66d9ef">4.</span>  <span style="font-weight:bold">**Financial Stress Reduction:**</span> Elaborate on how a post-nuptial agreement can alleviate financial stress within a marriage by providing clarity and certainty regarding finances.
</span></span><span style="display:flex;"><span><span style="color:#66d9ef">5.</span>  <span style="font-weight:bold">**Key Considerations:**</span> Outline key considerations for creating a valid and enforceable post-nuptial agreement. This should include the importance of independent legal counsel, full financial disclosure, and fairness.
</span></span><span style="display:flex;"><span><span style="color:#66d9ef">6.</span>  <span style="font-weight:bold">**Conclusion:**</span> Summarize the benefits of post-nuptial agreements and encourage couples to seek professional legal advice if considering one.
</span></span><span style="display:flex;"><span>
</span></span><span style="display:flex;"><span># Constraints
</span></span><span style="display:flex;"><span><span style="color:#66d9ef">1.</span>  The guide should be written in clear, concise, and easy-to-understand language, avoiding legal jargon where possible.
</span></span><span style="display:flex;"><span><span style="color:#66d9ef">2.</span>  Maintain a neutral and objective tone, presenting both the advantages and potential drawbacks of post-nuptial agreements.
</span></span><span style="display:flex;"><span><span style="color:#66d9ef">3.</span>  The guide should be approximately 800-1200 words in length.
</span></span><span style="display:flex;"><span><span style="color:#66d9ef">4.</span>  Ensure the information provided is accurate and reflects current legal practices regarding post-nuptial agreements.
</span></span><span style="display:flex;"><span><span style="color:#66d9ef">5.</span>  Do not provide legal advice specific to any jurisdiction. Instead, provide general guidance applicable across various jurisdictions.
</span></span><span style="display:flex;"><span>
</span></span><span style="display:flex;"><span># Output Format
</span></span><span style="display:flex;"><span>Markdown document.
</span></span></code></pre></div><h2 id="-pro-tips">💡 Pro Tips</h2>
<ol>
<li>Tailor the &ldquo;Context&rdquo; section with specific scenarios or situations you want the guide to address. This will help the AI focus on relevant information. For example, if you have a specific state in mind (though the instructions prohibit specific legal advice), mentioning common business types in that state can help shape the examples.</li>
<li>Consider adding &ldquo;Examples&rdquo; within the &ldquo;Task&rdquo; section to guide the AI on the level of detail expected for the hypothetical scenarios. For example, request that business valuation scenarios involve &ldquo;Discounted Cash Flow&rdquo; or &ldquo;Market Multiple&rdquo; analysis (while ensuring the overall tone remains accessible).</li>
<li>Experiment with different &ldquo;Role&rdquo; assignments, such as &ldquo;Certified Financial Planner specializing in divorce&rdquo; or &ldquo;Relationship Counselor with legal training&rdquo; to see how the tone and emphasis of the guide change. Recommended model: GPT-4o.</li>
