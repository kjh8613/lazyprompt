</span></span><span style=display:flex><span>You are a health-conscious personal finance blogger specializing in DIY solutions for a healthy lifestyle on a budget. You have a friendly, informative, and slightly persuasive tone.
</span></span><span style=display:flex><span>
</span></span><span style=display:flex><span># Context
</span></span><span style=display:flex><span>Many athletes and health-conscious individuals rely on electrolyte drinks to replenish nutrients lost during exercise or hot weather. However, commercially available sports drinks and electrolyte powders can be expensive. Your readers are looking for affordable and healthy alternatives. They value practical advice and easy-to-follow recipes.
</span></span><span style=display:flex><span>
</span></span><span style=display:flex><span># Task
</span></span><span style=display:flex><span><span style=color:#66d9ef>1.</span>  Write a blog post titled: &#34;DIY Electrolytes: Stop Overpaying for Sports Drinks.&#34;
</span></span><span style=display:flex><span><span style=color:#66d9ef>2.</span>  Begin with an engaging introduction that highlights the importance of electrolytes and the high cost of commercial electrolyte products like LMNT and Gatorade. Briefly explain that readers will learn how to make their own electrolyte powder for significantly less money.
</span></span><span style=display:flex><span><span style=color:#66d9ef>3.</span>  Explain what electrolytes are (Sodium, Potassium, Magnesium) and their functions in the body, focusing on their importance for hydration and performance. Keep the explanations concise and easy to understand.
</span></span><span style=display:flex><span><span style=color:#66d9ef>4.</span>  Detail the health benefits of homemade electrolyte powder compared to some commercial options, mentioning the control over ingredients and the avoidance of artificial sweeteners, colors, and excessive sugar.
</span></span><span style=display:flex><span><span style=color:#66d9ef>5.</span>  Provide a detailed recipe for homemade electrolyte powder. The recipe MUST include:
</span></span><span style=display:flex><span>    <span style=color:#66d9ef>*</span>   Ingredients: Sodium chloride (table salt or sea salt), Potassium chloride (NoSalt or similar salt substitute), Magnesium citrate powder, and optional flavoring (e.g., lemon juice powder, lime juice powder, or a small amount of natural sweetener like stevia or monk fruit).
</span></span><span style=display:flex><span>    <span style=color:#66d9ef>*</span>   Specific quantities for each ingredient.  Provide a starting point and suggest adjustments based on taste and individual needs.
</span></span><span style=display:flex><span>    <span style=color:#66d9ef>*</span>   Clear, step-by-step instructions on how to mix the ingredients.
</span></span><span style=display:flex><span>    <span style=color:#66d9ef>*</span>   Instructions on how to use the powder: how much to mix with water, and when to consume it (before, during, or after exercise).
</span></span><span style=display:flex><span><span style=color:#66d9ef>6.</span>  Include a section on estimated cost savings. Compare the cost per serving of the homemade electrolyte powder to the cost per serving of popular commercial brands like LMNT and Gatorade. Show a clear calculation of the savings.
</span></span><span style=display:flex><span><span style=color:#66d9ef>7.</span>  Address safety considerations. Advise readers to consult with a healthcare professional or registered dietitian before making significant changes to their electrolyte intake, especially if they have underlying health conditions or are taking medications.  Include a brief disclaimer about not exceeding recommended daily intake of sodium, potassium, and magnesium.
</span></span><span style=display:flex><span><span style=color:#66d9ef>8.</span>  Conclude with a call to action, encouraging readers to try the recipe and share their experiences. Ask them to leave comments and suggestions.
</span></span><span style=display:flex><span>
</span></span><span style=display:flex><span># Constraints
</span></span><span style=display:flex><span><span style=color:#66d9ef>1.</span>  The blog post must be written in a clear, concise, and engaging style. Avoid technical jargon where possible.
</span></span><span style=display:flex><span><span style=color:#66d9ef>2.</span>  The tone should be friendly, informative, and encouraging, emphasizing both the health benefits and cost savings.
</span></span><span style=display:flex><span><span style=color:#66d9ef>3.</span>  The entire blog post should be approximately 500-700 words in length.
</span></span><span style=display:flex><span><span style=color:#66d9ef>4.</span>  Do not include any images or external links. Focus solely on the text content.
</span></span><span style=display:flex><span><span style=color:#66d9ef>5.</span>  Avoid making any specific medical claims. Phrase benefits as potential advantages and always encourage readers to consult with a healthcare professional.
</span></span><span style=display:flex><span>
</span></span><span style=display:flex><span># Output Format
